</div>

<p>It is fifty years ago, this year 1919, that the first of
the iron trails across the United States, between the
East and the West, was finally completed. At noon
of May 10, 1869, the last four rails in the new Pacific
Railway were laid, and upon Promontory Point, Utah,
about fifty miles westward from Ogden, the locomotive
of the Union Pacific and the locomotive of the
Central Pacific touched noses. That was indeed a
great event.</p>

<p>The Union Pacific, coming from Omaha at the
Missouri River, had built over one thousand miles of
track in three years; the Central Pacific, coming from
Sacramento at the Pacific Ocean, had built over six
hundred miles in the same space. Altogether, in seven
years there had been built one thousand, seven hundred
and seventy-five miles of main track, and the
side-tracks, stations, water-tanks, and so forth.</p>

<p>In one year the Union Pacific had laid four hundred
and twenty-five miles of track; in the same year the
Central Pacific had laid three hundred and sixty-three
miles. In one day the Union Pacific had laid seven
and three-quarters miles; in one day the Central
Pacific had laid a full ten miles. These records have
never been beaten.</p>

<p>The whole thing was a feat equaled again only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span>
when America speeded up in the war against Germany;
for when they once get started, Americans
astonish the world.</p>

<p>Twenty-five thousand men, including boys, were
working at one time, on the twain roads. This book
tells of the experiences of Terry Richards and George
Stanton, who were two out of the twenty-five thousand;
and of their friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rousing chant rang gaily upon the thin air of
Western spring. Sitting Jenny, the old yellow mule,
for a moment’s breather while the load of rails was
being swept from his flat-car truck, Terry Richards
had to smile.</p>

<p>Nobody knew who invented that song. Some said
Paddy Miles, the track-laying boss—and it did sound
like Pat. At any rate, the lines had made a hit, until
already their words were echoing from the Omaha
yards, the beginning of track, past end o’ track and on
through the grading-camps clear to the mountains
where the surveying parties were spying out the trail,
for this new Union Pacific Railroad across continent.</p>

<p>Time, early in May, 1867. Place, end o’ track, on
the Great Plains just north of the Platte River, between
North Platte Station of west central Nebraska
and Julesburg, the old Overland Stage Station, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
northeastern Colorado. Scene, track-laying—a bevy
of sweaty, flannel-shirted, cowhide-booted men working
like beavers, but with spades, picks, sledges,
wrenches and hands, while far before were the graders,
keeping ahead, and behind were the boarding-train
and the construction-train, puffing back and forth.</p>

<p>Aye, this was a bustling scene, here where a few
weeks ago there had been open country traveled by
only the emigrant wagons, the stages and the Indians.</p>

<p>And yonder, farther than the graders and out of
sight in the northwest, there were still more workers
on the big job: the location surveyors, the path-finding
surveyors, the—but Terry’s breather was cut short.</p>

<p>“All right!” yelped the command, from the front.</p>

<p>Terry’s empty truck was tipped sideways from the
single track. A second little flat-car, hauled by a
galloping white horse ridden by small red-headed Jimmie
Muldoon, passed full speed, bound to the fray
with more rails. Terry’s own car was tipped back
upon the track again, one-legged Dennis, its “conductor,”
hopped aboard, to the brakes, and uttering a
whoop Terry started, to get another load, himself.</p>

<p>Old Jenny headed down track, by the path that she
had worn; the fifty feet of rope tautened; with the
truck rumbling after and Shep, Terry’s shaggy black
dog, romping alongside, they tore for the fresh supplies.
Sitting bareback, Terry rode like an Indian.</p>

<p>At the waiting pile of rails dumped from the construction-train
he swerved Jenny out, and halted. The
light flat-car rolled on until Dennis (who had been
crippled in the war) stopped it with the brake. Instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
the rail-slingers there began to load it. And
presently Terry was launched once more for end o’
track, with his cargo of forty rails to be placed, lightning
quick, upon the ties.</p>

<p>Jimmie’s emptied truck was tipped aside, to give
clearance. Then Jimmie pelted rearward, for iron
ammunition, and Terry had another breather.</p>

<p>That was a great system by which at the rate of a
mile and a half to two miles and a half and sometimes
three miles a day the rails for the Iron Horse were
being laid to the land of the setting sun.</p>

<p>Beyond end o’ track the graded roadbed stretched
straight into the west as far as eye could see, with a
graders’ camp of sodded dug-outs and dingy tents
breaking the distance. At the tapering-off place the
ploughs and scrapers were busy, building the roadbed.
Next there came the shovel and pick squads, leveling
the roadbed. Next, between end o’ track and shovel
squads, there were the tie-layers—seizing the ties
from the piles, throwing them upon the roadbed, tamping
them and straightening them and constantly asking
for more, while six-horse and six-mule wagons
toiled up and down, hauling all kinds of material to
the “front.”</p>

<p>Already the row of ties laid yesterday and this very
morning extended like a rippling stream for three
miles, inviting the rails.</p>

<p>At end o’ track itself there were the track-builders—the
rail-layers, the gaugers, the spikers, the bolters,
the ballasters. And upon the new track there were
the boarding-train and the construction-train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>The boarding-train, for the track-gang, held the advance.
It was a long train of box-cars fitted up with
bunks and dining tables and kitchen—with hammocks
slung underneath to the cross-rods and beds made up
on top, for the over-flow; and with one car used as an
office by General “Jack” Casement and his brother,
Dan Casement, who were building the road for the
U. P.</p>

<p>The construction-train of flat-cars and caboose plied
back and forth between end o’ track and the last supply
depot, twenty miles back. These supply depots, linked
by construction-trains, were located every twenty miles,
on the plains beside the track, back to North Platte, the
supply base.</p>

<p>From its depot the train for end o’ track brought up
rails, ties, spikes, fish-plate joints—everything. It
backed in until its caboose almost touched the rear
car of the boarding-train. Overboard went the loads
from the flat-cars; with a shrill whistle, away for another
outfit of track stuff puffed the construction-train;
with answering whistle the boarding-train
(Terry’s father at the throttle) followed, a short distance,
to clear the path for the rail-trucks.</p>

<p>The rail-truck, Terry’s or Jimmie Muldoon’s, according
to whose turn, loaded at the farthest pile. Then up
track it scampered, to the very end, where two lines
of track-layers, five on a side, were waiting. Each
squad grabbed a rail, man after man, and hustled it
forward at a run; dropped it so skillfully that the rear
end fell into the last fish-plate. They forced the end
down, and held the rail straight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>“Down!” signaled the squad bosses. The gaugers
had measured the width between the pair of rails: four
feet eight and one-half inches. The spikers and bolters
sprang with spikes and bolts and sledges. “Whang!
Whang! Whangity-whang!” pealed the sledges—a
rhythmic chorus. By the time that the first spikes had
been driven two more rails were in position. Now
and again the little car was shoved forward a few
yards, on the new track, to keep up with the work.</p>

<p>A pair of rails were laid—“Down! Down!”—every
thirty seconds! Two hundred pairs of rails
were reckoned to the mile; there were ten spikes to
each rail, three sledge blows to each spike. A pair of
rails were laid and spiked fast every minute, which
meant a mile of track in three hours and a third—or
say three and a half. In fifteen minutes the fish-plate
joints had been bolted and everything made
taut.</p>

<p>It was a clock-work job, at top speed, with maybe
1,000 miles yet to go in this race to beat the Central
Pacific.</p>

<p>The Central Pacific was the road being built eastward
from Sacramento of California. The Government
had ordered the Union Pacific to meet it and join
end o’ track with it, somewhere west of the Rocky
Mountains. That would make a railroad clear across
continent between the Missouri River and the Pacific
Ocean!</p>

<p>The Union Pacific had much the longer trail: 1,000
miles across the plains and the Rockies and as much
farther as it could get. The Central Pacific had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
started in to build only about 150 miles, and then as
much farther as it could get, east from the California
border.</p>

<p>The C. P. had commenced first. By the time the
U. P. had built eleven miles of track, the C. P. had
completed over fifty. But while the Central was
completing 100 miles, the Union Pacific had completed
300.</p>

<p>Now the Central was still fighting the snowy Sierra
Nevada Mountains of eastern California, and the U. P.
had open going on the plains. The C. P. had plenty of
timber for ties and culverts and bridges, and plenty of
cheap Chinese labor; the U. P. had no timber, all its
ties were cut up and down the Missouri River or as
far east as Wisconsin, and hauled to end o’ track
from Omaha, and by the time that they were laid
they cost two dollars apiece. Its workmen were mainly
Irish, gathered from everywhere and pretty hard to
manage.</p>

<p>The C. P. began at Sacramento on the Sacramento
River, up from San Francisco, but its rails and locomotives
had to be shipped clear around Cape Horn,
from the Pennsylvania factories—or else across the
Isthmus of Panama. The U. P. began at Omaha,
on the Missouri River, but Omaha was 100 miles from
any eastern railroad and all the iron and other supplies
had to be shipped by steamboat up from St.
Louis or by wagon from central Iowa.</p>

<p>It was nip and tuck. Just the same, General G. M.
Dodge, the Union Pacific chief engineer (and a mighty
fine man), was bound to reach Salt Lake of Utah first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
where big business from the Mormons only waited for
a railroad. This year he had set out to build 288
more miles of track between April 1 and November 1.
That would take the U. P. to the Black Hills of the
Rocky Mountains. The C. P. had still forty miles
to go, before it was out of its mountains and down
into the Nevada desert; and this looked like a year’s
work, also.</p>

<p>Then the U. P. would be tackling the mountains,
while the C. P. had the desert, with Salt Lake as the
prize for both.</p>

<p>But 288 miles, this year, against the Central’s forty!
Phew! No matter. General Dodge was the man to
do it, and the U. P. gangs believed that they could
beat the C. P. gangs to a frazzle.</p>

<p>“B’ gorry, ’tis the Paddies ag’in the Chinks, it is?”
growled Pat Miles, the track-laying boss. “Ould
Ireland foriver! Shall the like of us let a lot o’ pig-tailed,
rice-’atin’ haythen wid shovels an’ picks hoist
the yaller above the grane? Niver! Not whilst we
have a man who can spit on his hands. Away yonder
on that desert over ferninst Californy won’t there
be a shindig, though, when the shillaly meets the chop-stick!
For ’tis not at Salt Lake we’ll stop; we’ll kape
right on into Nevady, glory be!”</p>

<p>So——</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>And—“Down! Down!” “Whang! Whang!
Whangity-whang!”</p>

<p>The track-laying and the grading gangs were
red-shirted, blue-shirted, gray-shirted; with trousers
tucked into heavy boots—and many of the trousers
were the army blue. For though the men were mainly
Irish, they were Americans and two-thirds had fought
in the Union armies during the Civil War. Some also
had fought in the Confederate armies.</p>

<p>There were ex-sergeants, ex-corporals, and ex-privates
by the scores, working shoulder to shoulder.
In fact, the whole U. P. corps was like an army corps.
Chief Engineer Dodge had been a major-general in
the East and on the Plains; Chief Contractor “Jack”
Casement had been brigadier general; about all the
way-up men had been generals, colonels, majors, what-not;
while the workers under them were ready at a
moment to drop picks and shovels and sledges and
transits, and grabbing guns “fall in” as regular soldiers.</p>

<p>This meant a great deal, when the Indians were
fighting the road. This past winter the engineers doing
advance survey work had been told by Chief Red
Cloud of the Sioux that they must get out and stay
out of the country—but there they were there again.
Nobody could bluff those surveyors: fellows like
“Major” Marshall Hurd who had served as a private
of engineers through the war, and Tom Bates,
and young Percy Browne, and their parties.</p>

<p>All the survey parties—some of them 500 miles in
the lead—moved and worked, carrying guns; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
graders’ camps were little forts; the track-builders
marched to their jobs, and stacked their rifles while
they plied their tools. At night the guns were arranged
in racks in the boarding-cars, to be handy.
The construction-trains’ cabooses were padded with
sand between double walls, and loop-holed, and even
the passenger trains were supplied with rifles and revolvers,
in cars and cabs. General Dodge called his
private car, in which he shuttled up and down the line,
his “traveling arsenal.”</p>

<p>This was the arrangement, from the end o’ track
back to beginning, 360 miles, and on ahead to the last
survey camp. The Central Pacific was not having such
trouble.</p>

<p>“An’ lucky for it, too,” as said Paddy Miles. “For
betwixt the yaller an’ the red, sure I’d bet on the red.
Wan Injun could lick all the Chinymen on this side
the Paycific. But there’s niver an Injun who can lick
an Irishman, b’ gosh!”</p>

<p>However, today everything seemed peaceful.
Usually a detachment of soldiers, or a company of the
Pawnee Indian scouts under Major Frank M. North,
their white-scout commander, were camped near by,
guarding the track-laying. But the soldiers were elsewhere,
on a short cross-country trip, and the Pawnees
(Company A) were up at Fort Sedgwick, near old
Julesburg, fifteen or twenty miles west.</p>

<p>The air was very clear. The graders working on
the roadbed five miles away might be seen. The long
trains of huge wagons, hauling supplies, wended slowly
out to refit them. On this section there were 100 teams<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
and 2,000 men, scattered along; on the next section
there were another thousand men, doing the first grading
according to the stakes set by the engineers. And
eastward there were the trains and the stations, all
manned, and other gangs fixing the rough places in the
track.</p>

<p>Of all this Terry felt himself to be rather a small
part—just riding old Jenny back and forth, with the
little rail-truck, while his father imitated with the
engine of the boarding-train. Of course, his father
had a bad knee (which the war had made worse), and
driving an engine was important; but he himself envied
his chum, George Stanton. George was out with his
father on railroad survey under Mr. Tom Bates—probably
fighting Injuns and shooting buffalo and bear,
too. That also was man’s work, while riding an old
yellow mule over the track was boy’s work.</p>

<p>Every truck-load of forty rails carried the track forward
about 560 feet. To that steady “Down!
Down!” and “Whangity-whang!” end o’ track
reached out farther and farther from the piles of iron
thrown off by the construction-train, and from the
boarding-train that waited for the construction-train
to back in with another supply.</p>

<p>So while cleaning up the piles, Terry and little
Jimmie Muldoon had to travel farther and farther
with their loads. Then in due time the construction-train
would come puffing up, the boarding-train, with
Terry’s father leaning from the cab, would move on
as close to end o’ track as it dared, the construction-train
would follow and with a great noise dump its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
cargo of jangling iron, and retreat again; the boarding-train
would back out, to clear the track for the
trucks; and Terry and Jimmie would start in on short
hauls, for a spell.</p>

<p>The supply of iron at the last dump was almost
exhausted. The construction-train was hurrying in,
with more. Engine Driver Ralph Richards and his
stoker, Bill Sweeny, were climbing lazily into the cab
of old No. 119, ready to pull on up as soon as Jimmie
Muldoon’s truck left with the final load. Terry had
his eye upon the track, to see it emptied——</p>

<div class="verse">Drill, you tarriers, drill!</div>
<div class="verse">O, it’s work all day,</div>
<div class="verse">No sug——”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Hark! A sudden spatter of shots sounded—a
series of shouts and whoops—the whistle of the boarding-train
was wide open—up the grade the graders
were diving to cover like frightened prairie-dogs—and
out from the sandhills not a quarter of a mile
to the right there boiled a bevy of wild horsemen,
charging full tilt to join with another bevy who tore
down diagonally past the graders themselves.</p>

<p>Sioux? Or Cheyennes? The war had begun, for
1867!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>A LITTLE INTERRUPTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Indians had chosen exactly the right time, for
<i>them</i>. They had awaited the moment when the main
body of track-layers were farthest separated from the
boarding-train and the stacks of arms; they had seen
that there were no soldiers on guard; and here they
came, with a rush, at least 500 of them.</p>

<p>“Fall in, men! Lay down! Down wid yez!”</p>

<p>Terry tumbled off his yellow mule in a jiffy. Dropping
spade and sledge, ducking and lunging, the men
were scurrying along the roadbed, seeking shelter.
Only the squad of tampers and ballasters following end
o’ track to settle the ties were near the first gun stacks;
Terry joined their flat line. The Springfield carbines
were passed rapidly, but there were not enough.</p>

<p>“Stiddy, boys!” bawled Pat. He had been a top
sergeant in the regular army before the war. “Hug
the ground. The word from headquarters is ‘Niver
retrate.’ Sure, if we haven’t guns we can foight wid
picks. Wait for orders, now.”</p>

<p>Down dashed the Indians, at reckless speed: one
party straight from the north, one party obliquing from
the west. The engines of both trains were shrieking
furiously. All up the grade the wagons were bunching,
at a gallop, with military precision; the laborers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
were rushing in squads to corral in them and in the low
dug-outs beside the roadbed.</p>

<p>The party of Indians from the westward split; one
half veered in, and racing back and forth there, pelted
the road embankment with a storm of bullets and arrows.
The graders replied, but it was hard to land
on those weaving, scudding figures.</p>

<p>The other half of the party tore on, heading to
unite with the second party and cut off the boarding-train.
That was it! The Indians wanted the boarding-train
and supplies.</p>

<p>Hurrah! The boarding-train was coming on, regardless.
It was manned by only Engine Driver
Richards and Fireman Sweeny, a brakeman and the
cooks; but no matter. Like a great demon it was
coming on, whistling long shrieks and belching pitchy
smoke.</p>

<p>The Sioux (some Cheyennes, too) were close upon
it. They began to race it, whooping and shooting.
The windows of dining-car and caboose replied with
jets of white, as the cook and the brakeman bravely
defended. Stoker Bill shot from his side of the cab.
The train gathered way slowly; the ponies easily kept
up with it—their riders, swerving in, flung themselves
free of the saddles, clung to the steps and ladders and
vaulted the couplings; clung like ants and dragged
and writhed, as if they could hold it back!</p>

<p>They charged the engine; even cast their ropes at
the smoke-stack; swarmed to the tender and from there
shot into the cab. Terry’s heart welled into his mouth,
with fear for his father. Suddenly there was a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
gush of white steam—Engineer Richards had opened
the cylinder cocks, and the cloud of scalding vapor
surged back, sweeping the tender. Out popped
sprawly brown figures, to land head over heels upon
the right-of-way, and blindly scramble for safety.</p>

<p>Hurrah! Bully for Engineer Richards! And the
construction-train was coming too. No! Look at it!
From Terry’s neighbors a groan of disgust issued.</p>

<p>“The dirty cowards! Bad cess to ’em! Turnin’
tail, they are!”</p>

<p>For the construction-train was standing still, on the
track, and the engine was making off, back across the
wide plains, leaving a trail of smoke and a good-by
shriek.</p>

<p>“Niver mind! We’ve a train of our own. Yis, an’
hearts to match it.”</p>

<p>“’Tis all right, boys. He’s only goin’ to the tiligraph,”
Pat shouted. “It’s word to the troops at
Sidgwick he has up his sleeve. The Pawnees’ll be wid
us in a jiffy—an’ then watch them red rascals skedaddle.
’Asy, ’asy,” continued Pat, “till the train’s
widin reach of us. Stiddy. We mustn’t get scattered,
like.”</p>

<p>The boarding-train was jolting and swaying on the
newly laid rails; but what ailed it, besides? Aha!</p>

<p>“Settin’ the brakes! Settin’ the brakes, they are!”</p>

<p>And sure enough. These Cheyennes and Sioux
were wise. For a year and a half they had been
watching the white man’s iron horses and big thunder
wagons advancing onward into the buffalo country;
and they had learned a number of new wrinkles. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
were no longer afraid of the strange “medicine.” For
here they were, boldly tackling the cars, laying hands
upon them, climbing aboard—and setting the brakes!</p>

<p>Their almost naked figures, outlined against the sky,
atop the cars, tugged and hauled at the brake wheels.
The brake-shoes ground harshly; fumy smoke floated
from underneath, as the locked car-wheels slid on the
rails; the engine, with throttle open, roared vainly.
Out from the cab darted Fireman Bill Sweeny, mounted
the tender and, skipping to the first car, revolver in
hand, hung to the ladder while he raked the tops
beyond.</p>

<p>“Sharp-shooters give it to ’em!” Pat yelped. The
carbines of the track-layer gang banged hopefully.</p>

<p>The Indians ducked and swung off to the farther
side. The brakeman was out of the caboose. He lay
flat upon one end of the train, the fireman lay flat upon
the other end; and hitching along they began to kick
the brakes free. The galloping Indians peppered at
them, but failed to hit them.</p>

<p>“Be ready, lads,” Pat ordered. “Skirmishes wid
the guns, first. The rist of us wid the picks. We’ll
run for it, and meet the train. Jist a minute, now.”
And—“Oh, the divils!” he added. “Charge!”</p>

<p>A squad of the Indians, dismounted, had thrown a
tie across the track. A wild volley from the carbines
had not stayed them. Engineer Richards, plunged in
his own steam cloud, evidently did not see the tie;
he came on, pushing Jimmie Muldoon’s loaded truck
before him; the white horse tried to bolt and fell with
a broken neck just as the rope parted; the smoke-stack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
was atilt, and spitting smoke and steam from a dozen
bullet-holes; but twitched by the roaring engine, the
train moved faster and faster.</p>

<p>Up sprang the men, with a yell. The line of
skirmishers, carbines poised, charged—charged in
splendid order, like soldiers, aiming, firing, running.
With picks and sledges and even spades the other men
also charged, behind the skirmishers; bending low and
shouting, yes, laughing in their excitement.</p>

<p>“The tie! Look out for the tie on the track!” they
hallooed.</p>

<p>Terry had nothing to carry, and he was fast on his
feet. Never had he sprinted so, before. The first
thing he knew, he was through the skirmishers and
legging on by himself, while the bullets hummed by him
and every instant the distance between tie and truck was
lessening. All his eyes and thoughts were on that
tie. If the engine—his father’s engine—rammed it
with the rail-loaded truck—wow!</p>

<p>He lost his hat—he heard whoops and shouts and
excited Shep’s wild barking—the Indians on his side
were swerving off, before the carbine bullets—but
the engine was thundering down upon him, he saw
his father’s astonished grimy face peering from the cab
and he glimpsed the cars behind spewing naked figures.
Then he dived for the tie. He barely had time to lift
one end when the truck struck the tie, hurled it to
the left and him to the right; but they both fell clear,
for as he picked himself up the box-cars were rumbling
by, jerking to the sharply braked engine.</p>

<p>All was hurly-burly with the Indians scooting and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
screeching, the men scrambling and cheering, catching
at the steps and braces, running alongside until the
train stopped, and clutching the guns passed out from
doors and windows.</p>

<p>The dining-car door slid back; the sweaty faces of
the cook and cookee grinned down; the brakeman
leaped off——</p>

<p>“Fall in, now! Fall in wid yez!” were Pat’s orders.
“Take your distances ben’ath—two men to each pair
o’ wheels. An’ them that hasn’t guns lay flat inside.”</p>

<p>Terry had no notion of lying flat inside. He
plunged like a rabbit under the dining-car (bewildered
Shep at his heels), for a place between the rails; found
none, and dodged on, trying not to step on anybody
or be in the way. He arrived at the tender, and had
to come out.</p>

<p>“Get in here! Quick!” It was his father, sighting
him. Terry hoisted himself into the engine, while
several bullets rang upon the metal grasped by his
hands. He lurched to the fireman’s seat and huddled
there, to gain breath and grin. With a running leap
Shep followed, to curl close in a corner, safe, he
believed, from all that racket.</p>

<p>“Well, where were you going?” his father demanded.</p>

<p>“Just looking for a good place,” Terry panted.</p>

<p>“You’ve found it, and you’d better stick. ’Tisn’t
healthy, outside. What were you doing on the track
ahead of me? Didn’t I hit something?”</p>

<p>“A tie, dad. They’d laid a tie across the track.”</p>

<p>“Oho! Good for you. But you took a big chance.
Did you reach it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“I got one end up.”</p>

<p>“If I’d hit it plumb, reckon some of those rails
would have been driven into the boiler. I couldn’t
see plain, on account the steam and the truck. The
crooked stack bothered me, too. Anyhow, here’s one
train they don’t capture.”</p>

<p>“They can’t take it, can they, dad?”</p>

<p>“Not on your life, Terry. Not while there’s a
cartridge for a gun or an Irishman to swing a pick,
or an ounce of steam in the boiler of old 119. If
worst comes to worst we can run back and forth,
’twixt here and that construction-train.”</p>

<p>Terry jumped down and crawled to peek out between
engine and tender.</p>

<p>“No, we can’t, dad. They’re piling ties on the
track ’way behind!”</p>

<p>“I declare! They’re too smart. They even set
the brakes on me, and tried to rope the engine stack,
like they would a horse’s neck! So they think they
have us corralled, do they?”</p>

<p>That was so. The pesky Indian had daringly
charged to the farthest pile of ties—a spare pile—tied
ropes, and at a gallop dragging the ties to safer
distance were erecting a barricade upon the track.</p>

<p>Evidently they meant business, this time. It was
to be a fight to a finish. All up the graded roadbed
the U. P. men were fighting off the red bandits—fighting
from the dug-outs and the embankment and
the wagon corrals; they had no chance to sally to the
boarding-train. And here at the boarding-train
Paddy Miles’ track-layers were fighting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Part of the Indians dashed around and around in
a great circle, whooping gleefully and shooting at long
distance. “Blamed if they haven’t got better guns
than we have,” remarked Terry’s father, as now and
then a bullet pinged viciously against the boiler-iron
of engine or tank. Others, dismounted, crept steadily
forward, like snakes, firing from little hollows and
clumps of brush.</p>

<p>The Paddy Miles sharp-shooters, snug beneath the
cars, and protected by the rails and the car-wheels,
stanchly replied. The heavy Springfield balls kicked
up long spurts of sand and ’dobe dust; once in a while
a pony rider darted in, for closer shot—sometimes
he got away with it, and sometimes his horse lunged
headlong, to lie floundering while the rider himself
ran hunched, for shelter. Then the men cheered and
volleyed at him; maybe bowled him over, but not
always.</p>

<p>Terry’s father had lighted his pipe; and there he
sat, on his seat, with his gun poked out of the window,
to get a shot when he might. He was as cool as a
cucumber, and ready for any kind of business. This
was not his first scrape, by any means. He had been
a gold-seeker in the rush of Fifty-nine, to the Pike’s
Peak diggin’s of Colorado; and he had served in
the Union Army of the Civil War. Only his crippled
knee had put him into the cab—but brave men were
needed here, the same as elsewhere, these days.</p>

<p>“Where did the other engine go, dad?” Terry
asked.</p>

<p>“To the nearest wire. There’s a spur station and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
operator ten miles back, you know. Sedgwick has the
word, by now; and so has North Platte. Pretty soon
we’ll see the Pawnees coming from the one direction
and the general himself from the other; and that’ll put
an end to this fracas.”</p>

<p>Terry exclaimed.</p>

<p>“They’re shooting fire arrows!”</p>

<p>Cleverly worming along, several of the Indians had
posted themselves near enough to use their bows.
They launched arrow after arrow, with bunches of
flaming dried grass and greasy rags—yes, as like as
not old waste—tied to the heads; and these plumped
into car top and car side.</p>

<p>“The confounded rascals!” growled Engineer
Richards.</p>

<p>Fireman Bill Sweeny hurdled from the first car
down to the tender. He was sweat-streaked and
grim, and bleeding at the shoulder. He grabbed a
bucket, soused it into the tank, and away he staggered.</p>

<p>“Train’s afire, Ralph,” he yelled back. “Don’t
shove out——” and he was gone.</p>

<p>Forward bustled other men, with buckets; dipped
into the tank and sped for the rear again. Matters
were getting serious. The Springfields seemed unable
to ferret out the bow-wielders. There was a
cheer, and Pat Miles led a charge. Out from
beneath the cars there rushed a line of skirmishers,
while behind them the carbines barked, supporting
them. Up from their coverts sprang the fire-arrow
Indians, and bolted. Giving them a volley the
skirmish dropped and dug in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>A line was thrown out on the other side of the
train, also. This made the Indians furious; their
horsemen raced madly up and down, showing only
an arm and a leg, or suddenly firing from the saddle
and hanging low again. At the best they were difficult
marks. They had plenty of ammunition, and
rifles that outranged the stubby carbines.</p>

<p>“Fire’s squelched except the last car; that’s
a-burnin’,” gasped Stoker Bill, lurching in and sinking
breathless upon his seat. “Don’t back up. Say,
kid, help me tie this shoulder, will you?”</p>

<p>“Hurt bad, Bill?” Engineer Richards queried,
keenly.</p>

<p>“Nope. Just perforated a trifle.”</p>

<p>“Anybody else hurt?”</p>

<p>“None particular. But I sure thought this kid
was a goner, though. Did you see him?”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“When he reached for that tie?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t see him or the tie either, till too late. I
knew I hit something.”</p>

<p>“Well, I happened to be squinting up this way,
and I saw him just as he heaved an end clear of the
track. Next thing, you sent him one way and the tie
the other. He’s an all-right boy.”</p>

<p>“Guess he is,” laughed Terry’s father. “He’ll get
promoted off that old yellow mule, first thing we
know.”</p>

<p>“Wish General Dodge would let me go out on a
survey,” Terry blurted. “Like George Stanton.”</p>

<p>“I’ll speak to the general about it,” said Fireman
Bill, with a wink at his cab partner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>But Engineer Richards did not notice. He was
peering behind, out of his window.</p>

<p>“Hi! Here comes the other engine,” he uttered.
“Yes, and the headquarters car for a trailer! The
old man (that was Major-General Dodge, of course)
is inside it, I’ll bet a hat!”</p>

<p>They all looked. Far down the track an engine,
twitching a single car, was approaching. By her trail
of dense wood smoke and the way she bounced on
the little curves and bumps, she was making good time,
too.</p>

<p>“Chief boss is on the job, sure,” quoth Bill.</p>

<p>“Usually is,” added Terry’s father. “Always has
been. Nothing happens from one end of line to
t’other, but he’s there.”</p>

<p>The fighting track-layers had seen, and began to
cheer afresh. Away galloped a portion of the enemy,
to pester the reinforcements. But the engine came
right on, until it halted at the end of the construction-train.
Out from the headquarters car issued man
after man—springing to the ground, guns in their
hands, until they numbered some twenty.</p>

<p>The first was a straight, well-knit figure in broad-brimmed
black slouch hat and ordinary civilian
clothes. There appeared to be two or three men in
regular city clothes with him; the rest were dressed
more rough and ready, like trainmen and workmen.</p>

<p>The Indians were circling and yelling and shooting,
at long distance. The slouch hat led forward at a
run. From the construction-train the handful of train
crew leaped out; they had been housed, waiting, on defense,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
but helpless to do much. All ran forward.
The slouch hat man pointed and gave orders; the
train crew jumped at the pile of ties, while the other
men rapidly deployed, in accurate line—advancing
as if in uniform, and yielding not an inch.</p>

<p>The ties were scattered in a twinkling; the engine
pushed—the train moved slowly up track, with the
slouch hat’s men clearing either side of the track, at a
trot, fire, and trot again. The train crew closed the
rear. The engine whistled triumphantly; Terry’s
father yanked the whistle cord of No. 119, and by
blast after blast welcomed the new-comers.</p>

<p>In spite of the frantic Indians the trains joined.
But the fighting was not over. It had only been extended
into a longer line. Terry could stay quiet no
more. He simply had to be out into the midst of
things. With General Dodge, the chief engineer and
noted army man, on deck, there would be a change of
program.</p>

<p>“I’m going, dad,” he announced. Not waiting for
answer, out he tumbled, so quickly that Shep did not
know it. For Shep was sound asleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>“TRACK’S CLEAR”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> few carbine barrels jutting here and there from
behind the car-wheels were silent, as hugging the side
of the train Terry boldly stepped over them; the
skirmish lines were doing the shooting. Half way
down the train a knot of men were holding a council.</p>

<p>They were Chief Engineer Dodge (the figure in the
black slouch hat) and three men in city clothes, and
Pat Miles. But before Terry might steal nearer, fresh
cheers arose.</p>

<p>“The Pawnees! Here they come! Hooray for
the Pawnees!”</p>

<p>The men underneath the cars began to squirm out,
and stand, to yell. Over a swale up the graded right-of-way
there appeared a mounted force—looked like
soldiers—cavalry—one company, two companies,
deploying in broad front; and how they did come!</p>

<p>The graders yonder were waving hats, and cheering;
the Cheyennes and Sioux hemming them in dug
their heels into their ponies and bending low fled before
the charge. The General Dodge council had
moved out a few paces, to watch. The general swung
his hat, also.</p>

<p>“Now for it!” he shouted. “Form your men, Pat.
Blair, you wanted to see some fighting. Take one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
company and advance to the left. Simpson, you
take another detachment and advance to the right.
White, you and I and Pat will guard the train with
the train crews and the reserve. We’ll put those
rascals between two fires.”</p>

<p>“Fall in! Fall in wid yez!” Pat bawled, running.
The words were repeated. “Yez’ve thray gin’rals,
a major an’ meself to lead yez,” bawled Pat.</p>

<p>“Come on, men,” cried the general named Blair,
to his detachment; he climbed through between the
cars; his men followed him and away they went, in
extended order, picking up the skirmishers as they proceeded.</p>

<p>In the other direction ran General Simpson’s detachment,
and out across the plain. But the Indians
did not stand. With answering yells they scattered,
and occasionally firing backward at the Pawnees they
scoured away—the Pawnees, separating into their
two companies, pursuing madly.</p>

<p>And a funny sight it was, too; for as the Pawnees
rode, they kept throwing off their uniforms, until
pretty soon they were riding in only their trousers.</p>

<p>“B’ gorry!” Pat panted, as he and the general
halted near Terry. “The only thing I have ag’in them
Pawnees is, that when they come there’s nothin’ left
for the Irish.” He turned on the general, and saluted—coming
to a carry arms, with his left arm stiffly
across his red-shirted chest. “Track’s clear, gin’ral.”</p>

<p>“So it seems,” laughed General Dodge. “Simpson
and Blair might as well come in. Now let’s see what
the damage is.” His sharp eyes fell on Terry, standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
fascinated. “What’s this boy doing out here?
He ought to be under cover.”</p>

<p>“Sure, he’s bigger’n he looks,” apologized Pat.
“If ye could have seen him lift at a tie when the
engine was jest onto it——! He earned a brevet—but
I thought he was under the wheels entoirely.”</p>

<p>“That’s the kind of work that counts—but I’ll
have to hear about it later,” answered the general.
“Now let’s check up the damage, and get the men out
again. Where’s General Casement?”</p>

<p>“He’s on up at Julesburg, sorr; him and Mr. Reed,
too. But I’m thinkin’ they’ll both be back in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>General “Jack” Casement was the chief contractor—the
head boss of the whole construction. Mr. S. B.
Reed was the general superintendent of building.
Yes, they doubtless would arrive on the jump.</p>

<p>The two companies of the construction gang were
brought in, for the Pawnees had chased the Sioux and
Cheyennes out of sight. Before they came in, themselves,
General Dodge and Foreman Pat had made
their inspection. Three men badly wounded, here;
several slightly wounded; one car burned, other cars,
and the engine, riddled and scarred.</p>

<p>But within half an hour all the unhurt men had
stacked their guns, had resumed their tools, and were
out on the grade, ready to start in, just as though
there had been no fight.</p>

<p>Jenny the yellow mule had a bullet hole through
her ear; Jimmie Muldoon’s white horse was dead; but
speedily he and Terry were mounted again, waiting
for the construction-train to finish unloading, and for
the boarding-train to back out and clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>That was the system of the U. P., building across
the plains into the Far West.</p>

<p>“Hey, Jimmie! Where were you?” hailed Terry.</p>

<p>“I got behind the cook’s stove,” piped little Jimmie,
blushing as red as his hair. “But I came out and
handed ca’tridges. Weren’t you afraid?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. I guess I was too excited.”</p>

<p>“You done well, anyhow,” praised Jimmie, with
disregard of grammar.</p>

<p>General Dodge went on up the grade, inspecting.
The three men in city clothes, with him, were General
J. H. Simpson, of the United States Engineer
Corps; General Frank P. Blair, who had been one of
the youngest major-generals in the Civil War; and
Congressman H. M. White, who was called “Major”
and “Doctor.” They formed a board of inspectors,
or commissioners, sent out by the Government to
examine every twenty or forty miles of the road, when
finished, and accept it.</p>

<p>The United States was lending money for the building
of the first railroad across continent, and naturally
wished to see that the money was being well
spent.</p>

<p>The commissioners traveled in a special coach,
called the “Lincoln” coach because it had been made
for President Abraham Lincoln, during the War.
The railroad had bought it, for the use of officials.</p>

<p>Now it was back at North Platte, the terminus.
When the commissioners heard of the fight, they had
volunteered to come along with General Dodge and
help out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="indent">Wor-rkin’ on th’ U. Pay. Ra-a-ailway!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The construction-train had dumped its iron, the
boarding-train had backed out, and Jimmie and Terry
again plied back and forth, with the rails.</p>

<p>The Pawnees returned, in high feather like a lot
of boys themselves. They certainly were fighters.
Major Frank M. North, a white man, was their commander.
He had lived among them, and spoke their
language, and they’d follow him to the death. He
had enlisted four companies—drilled them as regular
cavalry, according to army regulations; they were
sworn into the United States Army as scouts, and
were deadly enemies to the Sioux and the Cheyennes.
The Sioux and Cheyennes feared them so, that it was
said a company of North’s Pawnees was worth more
than a regiment of regular soldiers. When these
Pawnees sighted an enemy, they simply threw off their
clothes and waded right in.</p>

<p>The two companies, A and B, made camp on the
plains, a little distance off, near the Platte River.
Major North and Chief Petalesharo—who was the
war-chief and son of old Petalesharo, known as “bravest
of the braves”—cantered forward to the track.
The major wore buckskin and long hair, like a frontiersman.
Petalesharo wore army pants with the seat
cut out, and the legs sewed tight, same as leggins.</p>

<p>“Take any hair, major?” was the call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Yes; there are three or four fresh scalps in the
camp yonder. But most of the beggars got away too
fast.”</p>

<p>“Say, Pete! Heap fight, what?”</p>

<p>Petalesharo smiled and grunted, with wave of hand.</p>

<p>“He says the Sioux ponies have long legs,” called
Major North. “Where’s the general? He was here,
wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he’s up ahead, with the graders.”</p>

<p>The major—young and daring and very popular—rode
on with Chief “Pete,” as if to report to
General Dodge.</p>

<p>They all came back together, after a time—and
the newly laid track was advancing to meet them.
Already the boarding-train had moved up a notch.
The Pawnees from the camp were scattered along,
watching the progress. The way with which the
white man’s road grew, before their eyes, seemed to
be a constant marvel to them.</p>

<p>“Faith, we’ll build our two miles this day in spite
o’ the Injuns,” cheered the sweaty Pat, everywhere
at once and urging on the toiling men.</p>

<p>The three commissioners were as interested as the
Pawnees; they hung around, while Chief Engineer
Dodge, General Jack Casement and Supervising Engineer
Reed (who had arrived horseback) conferred
in the headquarters car.</p>

<p>General Simpson and Dr. White had seen the track-laying
gang at work last year, but this was young
General Blair’s first trip out. Now while he was here,
three-quarters of a mile of track was laid before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
call for supper sounded; and as the men rushed to meet
the train, Engineer Richards unhooked and gave the
three commissioners a ride on the cow-catcher to the
very end o’ track, to show them how well the rails
had been put down.</p>

<p>In honor of the commissioners, after supper there
was a parade of the Pawnees, under Major North
and the white captains Lute North and Mr. Morse,
Lieutenants Beecher and Matthews, and Chief Petalesharo.</p>

<p>A great parade it was, too—“Might call it a dress
p’rade, and ag’in ye might call it an undress p’rade,”
as Foreman Pat remarked. The Pawnees were in all
kinds of costume: some wore cavalry blouses and
left their legs naked; some wore cavalry trousers
with the seats cut out, and left their bodies naked;
some wore large black campaign hats of Civil War
time, with brass bugles and crossed muskets and
crossed cannon, on the front; some wore nothing but
breech clouts, and brass spurs on their naked heels;
but they kept excellent line and wheeled and trotted
at word of command.</p>

<p>They broke up with a wild yell, and away they went,
careening over the plain, whooping and prancing and
shooting, and taking scalps—chasing the “Sioux.”</p>

<p>“The gin’ral wants to see you,” ordered Pat, of
Terry. “Ye’ll find him in his car yon. Now stand
on your feet an’ take off your hat an’ do the polite,
an’ mebbe it’s promoted you’ll be.”</p>

<p>So Terry, with Shep close following, trudged down
the line of box-cars, to the Chief Engineer’s “traveling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
arsenal.” He was curious to see the inside of it.
This was the general’s home, in which he toured up
and down the line, from Omaha to the end o’ track,
caring not a whit for the Indians.</p>

<p>It was fitted up inside with bunks and a desk and
racked guns, and a forward compartment which was
dining-room and kitchen, ruled by a darky cook.
When the general was not traveling in his car, he
was out overseeing the surveys far beyond the railroad;
he had explored through the plains and mountains
to Salt Lake long before the railroad had started
at Omaha.</p>

<p>The whole party were in the car; the three commissioners
(General Simpson was a famous explorer, too),
and General Casement, and Superintendent Reed, sitting
with General Dodge. Terry removed his dusty
hat, and stood in the doorway. Shep stuck his black
nose past his legs, to gaze and sniff.</p>

<p>“Hello, my boy,” General Dodge greeted.</p>

<p>“Pat Miles said you wanted to see me, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Come in, dog and all. Gentlemen,
this is Terry Richards. They tell me he risked his
life to save the boarding-train from being wrecked
during the Indian attack. I move that we all shake
hands with him.”</p>

<p>Terry, considerably flustrated, had his hand shaken,
all ’round.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s your job, Terry?” asked General
Dodge. He was a handsome man, every inch a soldier,
but with a very kind eye above a dark, trimmed
beard. Nobody could feel afraid of General Dodge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“I help bring up the rails, on a truck. I ride a
yellow mule, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’re rather a big boy to be doing that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but that’s my job. Somebody has to
do it. The men have got to have rails.”</p>

<p>“Very necessary, in building a railroad,” laughed
General Blair.</p>

<p>“We did almost two miles today,” informed Terry.
“We’d have done two miles sure if the Injuns hadn’t
tried to stop us.”</p>

<p>“That’s the right spirit,” approved General Simpson.</p>

<p>“General Casement is responsible for it,” quickly
spoke Chief Engineer Dodge. “His men are trained
to the minute, either to work or to fight. But the
Union Pacific Company doesn’t overlook individual
acts of bravery. What would you like to do instead
of riding that yellow mule, Terry?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to be out in front, exploring with the engineers,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you would!” General Dodge’s eyes kindled.
Evidently he liked that kind of work, himself.
“Why? It’s the most dangerous job of all—away
out in the Indian country, with only a handful of
men and maybe no help except your own guns.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d like it, though,” stammered Terry.
“If I could be any use, George Stanton’s out there
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Who’s George Stanton?”</p>

<p>“He’s another boy. He’s my pardner. We were
station hands on the Overland [that was the stage line]
before we joined the railroad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“Where is George?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, exactly. He went out with his
father in Mr. Bates’ survey party, as a sort of a cub
to learn engineering. I guess he cuts stakes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. The Bates party are bound from
Utah, to run a line this way. But they’ll not be back
before winter. Probably none of the survey parties
will turn up before winter. I’m afraid it’s too late
for a job with the engineers in the field, this year.
Maybe you’ll have to stick to your old mule, and
haul rails for General Casement.”</p>

<p>“Well, if there’s nothing better I can do,” agreed
Terry. “It’s fun to help the track go forward, anyhow.
We’ll beat the Central folks.”</p>

<p>“Yes, siree!” General Casement declared. He was
a great little man, this General “Jack” Casement:
a wiry, nervy, snappy little man, not much more than
five feet tall, peaceful weight about 135 pounds and
fighting weight about a ton—“an’ sure there’s sand
enough in him to ballast the tracks clear to Californy,”
Pat asserted. He had a brown beard and a bold blue
eye and a voice like a whip-crack. His brother
“Dan” Casement was smaller still, outside, but just
as big inside. They two were commanders of the
grading and track-laying outfits.</p>

<p>“There’s one more party to go out yet,” General
Dodge suddenly said; “and that’s mine. If General
Casement will lend you to me, maybe I’ll have a place
for you. We’ll see if we can’t find the Bates party,
and George Stanton.” And he added, with a smile,
to the other men: “A fellow can always use a boy,
around camp, you know, gentlemen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Golly! I’d sure like to go, sir,” Terry blurted.</p>

<p>“Were you ever farther west?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I helped drive stage, when I was working
for the Overland. And George and I had a pass
to Salt Lake, but George broke his leg up on the
divide, in the mountains, so we quit and came back.”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to get a pass?”</p>

<p>“Just for something we did. We brought a stage
through, when the driver was near frozen. ’Twasn’t
much, though. But we were glad to get a pass. We’d
never been west over the line.”</p>

<p>“How far east have you been over this line?” asked
the general, keenly.</p>

<p>“North Platte, is all. I joined at North Platte,
this spring, when you began the big push to make
290 miles before stopping again.”</p>

<p>“Two hundred and eighty-eight,” the general corrected.
“That will take us to Fort Sanders in the
Laramie Plains. But I think you ought to inspect
what’s been done in the two other years. It’s up to
the Union Pacific to treat you as well as the Overland
treated you. Did you ever ride on a railroad?”</p>

<p>“I guess I did when I was little, before we came
out to Kansas. We drove out to Kansas from Ohio
in 1858; but after that Harry Revere and I drove
across to Denver.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Harry Revere?”</p>

<p>“He’s a friend of George and me. He was an
Overland man, too—he was station-keeper at Beaver
Creek station while George and I were hostlers. Then
he rode Pony Express for a while, between Bijou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Junction and Denver. He’s a dandy; as spunky as a
badger. He’s back east somewhere, on the railroad,
doing telegraphing.”</p>

<p>“You build railroads, but you don’t travel on them,
eh?” laughed General Blair.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. All I do is haul rails and watch ’em
being laid—but the graders don’t even see the rails.
They just shovel dirt.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be out of sight of the rails and the dirt,
too, if you go on that western trip with me,” General
Dodge said, grimly. “So first, you’d better get acquainted
with the finished end and see what those rails
that you’ve helped lay are being used for. Suppose
you stay right aboard this car and take a trip back,
of a couple of hundred miles, if General Casement
will spare you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll spare him if you’ll spare some of that 288
miles,” General Casement retorted. “You’re breaking
up my army.”</p>

<p>Evidently even a boy was important, these days.</p>

<p>“Jimmie Muldoon’s brother will spell me, while
I’m gone,” Terry proffered. “He can ride my mule.
Her name’s Jenny. She’s smart. She’d do the hauling
without anybody on her.”</p>

<p>“All right. You make your arrangements with
Pat and Jimmie Muldoon, then,” said General Casement.</p>

<p>“And I guess I’ll ask my father.”</p>

<p>“Where’s he?”</p>

<p>“He’s the engine driver for the boarding-train.
That’s his job, because he got crippled up in the
war.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“Oh, Ralph Richards?” queried General Dodge.
“He was one of my soldiers, in that same war.
You’re his boy, are you? Any more of the family
on the U. P.?”</p>

<p>“My mother’s down at Denver still, but here’s my
dog. His name’s Shep. He’d fight Injuns, only today
there was too much shooting, so he stayed in the
engine.”</p>

<p>“Well,” spoke the general, “you see your father
and Pat Miles and Jimmie Muldoon; then bring your
dog and come along back to the car. We’re going
down to North Platte tonight, and tomorrow I’ll take
you as far as Kearney, anyhow. How’ll that suit
you?”</p>

<p>“Fine, sir.” And Terry hustled out, his head in a
whirl of excitement.</p>

<p>Matters were speedily fixed; but before he could
return dusk had settled over the great expanse of
lonely plains. The Pawnees were on guard. Far up
the grade a few lights twinkled, from the graders’
camps. Already the track-layer gang were going to
bed; some inside the boarding-train, some on top, some
underneath—just as they all pleased.</p>

<p>Ordinarily Terry would have spread his blankets
on top, where there was plenty of fresh air. However,
this night he was to be a guest of the big chief,
General Dodge himself, in the headquarters car, for
a trip over the new U. P. Railroad, to see that the
rails were O. K.</p>

<p>And so was Shep. Shep usually tried to go wherever
Terry went—except, of course, when guns were
banging too recklessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>The men were still up, in the rear or office end of
the headquarters car, talking together.</p>

<p>“The rest of us won’t turn in till we’re back at
North Platte,” the general explained. “I’ve had a
bunk opened for you, up forward. Do you think you
can sleep?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I can always sleep,” Terry assured.</p>

<p>“All right. Good night. You won’t miss much.
We’ll probably lie over at North Platte till morning.”</p>

<p>The bunk was a clever arrangement. During the
day it was folded against the side of the car and nobody
would know it was there. At night it was let
down, and hung flat with a curtain in front of it.
The car probably had several such bunks. They were
something new, the invention of a Mr. Pullman; and
when Terry climbed into his, he found it mighty comfortable.
Shep curled underneath, between the seats.</p>

<p>Lying snug and warm, Terry prepared to calm himself,
and sleep; but the future looked very bright. He
caught his thoughts surging ahead, upon the survey
trip half promised by the general: maybe clear to
Utah, exploring and finding George and the Bates
party. Hooray! Indians, bear and buffalo, new
country—! Pshaw! He was getting wide awake.
He ought to sleep. So he began to figure.</p>

<p>Over 300 miles, so far, by the Union Pacific, in the
two years and a quarter; 700 miles yet to Salt Lake,
and then as much farther as they could get before
meeting the Central! The general had planned to
lay nearly 300 miles more—288 anyway—this year!
Whew! Forty car-loads of supplies to every mile;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
400 rails and 2,650 ties to every mile; ten spikes to
each rail, three blows of the sledge to each spike—then
how many rails, how many ties, how many sledge
blows, how many galloping charges back and forth
of Jenny and the little truck, to cross plains and deserts
and mountains and win the race with the Central?</p>

<p>This tour by train was going to be nice enough, but
it seemed tame compared with end o’ track work, and
with surveying. And the laying of the track looked
to be such a big job that perhaps General Casement
couldn’t spare him again. Shucks!</p>

<p>While figuring and bothering, Terry fell asleep.
He did not know that his trip east and back was not
going to be as tame as it appeared in advance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>DOWN THE LINE—AND BACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sometime</span> in the night he knew that they were in
motion—the engine was pushing them along, over
the track. But when he really woke up, they were
standing still, in daylight. North Platte, as like as
not; or maybe Kearney. No, it couldn’t be Kearney,
could it, for Kearney was 100 miles and more, and that
seemed a long way to go, in just one night. At any
rate, they were standing in some town; there was a
lot of noise outside, of shouting and engine-puffing
and feet-scuffling. So he put on his clothes in a jiffy
and jumped down through the curtains.</p>

<p>By the rattle of dishes and the smell of bacon
the cook was getting breakfast, but the main part
of the car was empty. Everybody had left. Seemed
as though General Dodge didn’t take time to sleep,
himself, for no other bunk was open. Here came old
Shep, yawning, from his night’s quarters. Terry
hastened to the platform, to find where they were.</p>

<p>North Platte, sure. They’d come only sixty or
seventy miles, and must have been lying here quite a
while. Yes, it was North Platte, on the south bank of
the North Platte River just above where the North
Platte joined the South Platte to help make the big
Platte.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>North Platte was the end of the road, for traffic;
the terminal point, that is. The freight and passenger
trains from Omaha, 293 miles, stopped here and went
back; only the construction-trains went on, with supplies
for end o’ track. But North Platte was considerable
of a place—and an awful tough place, too,
plumb full of gambling joints and saloons.</p>

<p>It had started up in a hurry, last December, when
the road had reached it and had made a terminal
point and supply depot of it, for the winter. There
hadn’t been a thing here, except a prairie-dog town—and
in three weeks there had been a brick round-house
to hold forty engines, and a station-house, and
a water tank heated by a stove so it wouldn’t freeze, and
a big hotel to cost $18,000, and a knock-down warehouse
(the kind that could be taken apart and fitted
together again) almost as large, for the Casement
Brothers, and fifteen or sixteen other business buildings,
and over a thousand people, including gamblers
and saloon keepers, living in all kinds of board and
sheet-iron and canvas shacks.</p>

<p>When Terry had joined the road, at the close of
winter, North Platte boasted 2,000 people, counting
the graders and track-layers, and was a “roaring”
town. There was some talk of making it the headquarters
of the Union Pacific, instead of Omaha.</p>

<p>It used to be livelier at night than in the day-time,
even; but it certainly was lively enough this morning.
A long freight-train was unloading ties and iron, to be
added to the great collection of ties and iron already
waiting for the haul onward to the next supply dump,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
toward end o’ track. A passenger train had pulled
in from Omaha. The passengers were trooping to
the Railroad House (which was the name of the $18,000
hotel) or to the eating-room in the Casement
Brothers’ portable warehouse, or bargaining to be taken
by wagons across the South Platte ford, where the
Overland Stage for Denver connected with the railroad.</p>

<p>As fast as the Union Pacific, on the north side of
the Platte River, lengthened its passenger haul from
Omaha, on the south side of the Platte River the
Overland Stage shortened its haul to Denver and Salt
Lake.</p>

<p>After a while there would be no stage haul needed,
through this country. The stages would run only between
Denver and wherever the railroad passed by,
north of it; and people would go through from the
Missouri River in two days instead of in six.</p>

<p>An engine and tender backed up and hooked on
to the Dodge car; a fine-looking car, which must be
the Lincoln car for the Government commissioners,
had been coupled on, behind. While Terry gazed
about, from his platform, trying to take in all the
sights, here came General Dodge and Superintendent
Reed, as if in a hurry.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” The general waved his arm at the
engineer, as he sprang up the steps. To ring of bell
and hiss of exhaust the little train started. There
was no time lost.</p>

<p>“Hello, young man,” the general greeted, to Terry.
“Ready for the day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I expect you’d like to begin with breakfast. So
would Mr. Reed and I. We’ve made one beginning
but we’ll make another. We all can eat and watch
things go past at the same time.”</p>

<p>Decidedly, it was fun to sit at a table and eat while
whirled along across country at a tremendous pace,
with the landscape flitting by in plain sight just outside
the windows.</p>

<p>“How fast are we going now, please?” Terry ventured.</p>

<p>The general looked at his watch a minute, and seemed
to be listening.</p>

<p>“About twenty-five miles an hour, I should judge.
Is that right, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Pretty nearly right,” agreed Superintendent Reed.</p>

<p>Whew! And when Ben Holladay, the King of the
Overland Stage, had made fourteen miles in an hour
with his special coach and a special team of fours,
that had seemed like a lightning trip.</p>

<p>They had thundered over the long bridge above the
North Platte River, and were scooting eastward, parallel
with the main Platte. From across the river the
emigrants who still stuck to their slow prairie schooners
or covered wagons, waved at the train. At a safe
distance some antelope fled, flashing their white rumps.
Prairie-dogs sat up at the mouth of their burrows, to
gaze.</p>

<p>Once in a while a ranch, with low adobe buildings,
might be seen, south of the river; and an old
stage station there, before or behind, was almost always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
in sight. The Overland had quit running, east
of Cottonwood station, near North Platte.</p>

<p>On this side of the river there was not much to see,
except the railroad telegraph poles, and the prairie-dogs,
and the line of rails that stretched clear to Omaha
on the Missouri River, and a side-station of one little
building which slipped by so quickly that Terry could
not read the sign.</p>

<p>The general and Superintendent Reed went back into
the Lincoln car, to talk with the commissioners there.
They left the headquarters car to Terry, Shep and the
black cook.</p>

<p>“How you like this sort o’ travel, boy?” queried
the cook, as he tidied the car with a dust-rag.</p>

<p>“We’re sure moving,” Terry grinned. “It beats
staging. How fast are we going now, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mebbe thirty miles an houah. Reckon we
gotto meet ’nother train. This heah road is shy on
meetin’ places yet. But, sho’, thirty miles ain’t nothin’,
boy. When the gin’ral heahs somethin’ callin’ him, he
jest tells this old cah to step on the injine’s tail, an’—woof!
’Way we go, fifty, mebbe fifty-five miles an
houah! Yessuh. Sometimes the gin’ral he likes to
show off a bit, too, when there’s gover’ment folks
abohd. He shuah gives ’em a ride, so they’ll know
this ain’t any play road, down today an’ up tomorrow.
Where you from?”</p>

<p>“End o’ track,” answered Terry.</p>

<p>“What you do there?”</p>

<p>“Haul rails.”</p>

<p>“Was you up there yestuhday, when they fit the Injuns?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“You bet. They found we were bad medicine,
too. They almost set the boarding-train on fire,
though. That was a right smart fight, till the general
and the Pawnees came and drove ’em off in a
jiffy.”</p>

<p>“Hi yi!” the cook chuckled. “We-all had jest
got into Nohth Platte when the gin’ral, he heard about
it. He’s a powerful fightin’ man, the gin’ral is. He’s
fit Injuns a lot o’ times befoh. An’ those commishners,
they’re fightin’ men, too; they done fit in the wah.
An’ there was a passel o’ seemed like white trash
here, who was quittin’ work on the road because
they’d got paid off. But the gin’ral, he calls out:
‘You boys, the Injuns are ’tackin’ our camps up the
road. Pile in, if you want to go with me.’ An’ they
shuah piled in, every last one of ’em, same as though
they hadn’t quit the road at all. Yessuh! An’ when
they piled in, this chile he piled out, t’other end. He
guessed like he wasn’t needed. Hi yi! No, suh!
He’s got too much scalp. His hair ain’t like white
man’s hair; it’s same length all ovuh his haid.”</p>

<p>“Indians don’t scalp negroes. They can’t. And
they think it’s bad medicine,” said Terry. “They
call you buffalo soldiers.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t no buff’lo soldiers. I’m a cook, an’ I
knowed they didn’t want no cook up yonduh,” the
darky retorted. “Yessuh. An’ in case it come on
night, Injuns might not make any diff’rence ’tween a
white man an’ a black man. No, suh.”</p>

<p>“Not unless they felt your hair,” laughed Terry.</p>

<p>The cook seemed to turn a shade pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“No Injun’s gwine to feel my hair. No, suh!
Not unless he can outrun this heah train; an’ then
when he reaches in he’s got to catch me, foh if I once
get out the othuh end—oh, boy! I’d jest hit the
ground twice between the train an’ Omaha. The Injuns’d
be sayin’ ‘There he goes’ the same time Omaha
was sayin’ ‘Heah he comes!’ Yessuh! I’m powerful
scared o’ Injuns. It’s gwine to be a mighty bad yeah,
foh Injuns, too.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I heard the gin’ral sayin’ so. I heard him
say he’d asked foh moh soldiers, to guard the line cl’ar
to the mountings. Yessuh. He’s asked Gin’ral Sherman.
How far you gwine?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. To Omaha, maybe. Why?”</p>

<p>“Got some kin there?”</p>

<p>“No. I’m riding for fun.”</p>

<p>“You ridin’ foh fun?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When you get to Omaha, then you gwine back
where you come from?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. I’ve got a job, at end o’ track.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it; don’t you do it, boy,” advised the
cook, as darkly as his face. “Don’t you ride ’round
these pahts foh fun. No, suh! An’ don’t you staht
back from Omaha till Gin’ral Sherman’s soldiers have
killed ev’ry one o’ them Injuns. Yessuh! You let
Gin’ral Sherman an’ Gin’ral Dodge ’tend to one end
o’ track, an’ you get a job at t’other end.”</p>

<p>Terry had to laugh, but the cook’s words struck
home. Matters looked bad. The Indians had started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
in, that was certain; and everybody appeared to think
that this was an “Injun” year. Somehow, he felt
that he was deserting his post. He was leaving Paddy
Miles and the gang to their troubles, and was making
for safety, himself.</p>

<p>“When do we stop next?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I dunno. Mebbe we’ll stop at Willow Island, foh
ohduhs; an’ mebbe we’ll stop at Kearney. Jest depends
on the gin’ral. We stop whenever we please, or
whenever the injineer needs wood an’ watuh, or whenever
we got to meet ’nothuh train.”</p>

<p>“How far is Kearney?”</p>

<p>“Hundred miles from Nohth Platte. We’ll get
there befoh noon, an’ we’ll get to Omaha befoh dark.
Yessuh, we’ll travel right along.”</p>

<p>The cook went on about his business, and Terry
stared out at the flying country, which danced a reel
in tune with the roaring wheels. This was great fun,
of course, to be speeding over the new Union Pacific
Railroad, in a private car, but——! And he wondered
how Jenny and Jimmie Muldoon’s brother were
holding down the job at end o’ track.</p>

<p>With a swoop and a whistle they rushed past a long
freight-train, waiting on a siding. At every siding
there was one of these long freights, plumb loaded
and headed west, or partly empty and headed east.</p>

<p>They might get a glimpse of Fort McPherson, at
Cottonwood Springs on the stage road along the other
side of the river. Then they whirled right through
Brady Island station of the railroad. But stop they
did at Willow Island, which bore the same name as
the old Overland station, across from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>The station buildings, except the station-house itself,
were of sod, and loop-holed so as to fight off
the Indians. They looked like a fort. A lot of cedar
bridge-piles and telegraph poles and cottonwood ties
were stacked here, brought in by ranchers’ wagons from
the places where they had been cut. The road didn’t
get much of such stuff, on these bare plains, but once
in a while there was a valley or some bottom-land with
a little timber growing. Cedar ties and cottonwood
ties were no good, though, until they were soaked in
zinc, to make them hard and lasting. The best ties
came from Missouri, Iowa and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The next stop was at Plum Creek, also named for
the old stage station, opposite; then there was a pause
on a side-track, to let another train by; and they were
off again. It certainly was fast work.</p>

<p>General Dodge entered his headquarters car.</p>

<p>“How do you like railroading, now?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Fine, sir. We go some, don’t we!”</p>

<p>“Rather beat the stages, or your old yellow mule,
that’s a fact,” the general admitted. “But if it wasn’t
for you fellows that lay the track in such good shape,
we couldn’t go at all.”</p>

<p>“And the men who discover the trail—they count
a heap, too, I guess,” Terry added.</p>

<p>“Yes, siree. The surveyors’ job is the most ticklish
job, especially out on the desert and in the mountains.
Track-layers, graders, and surveyors—they’re all
heroes. They do the hard work, but the people who
never see them don’t think of them. Well, will you
stay aboard into Omaha?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“Would I be a long time getting back?” Terry
queried.</p>

<p>“No, sir; not unless the road is tied up by Indian
trouble. I’ll put you on a train and send you right
through to North Platte; then you can jump a construction-train,
and keep going to end of track again.
You’ll have your pass.”</p>

<p>“Where do we stop next, please?” Terry asked.</p>

<p>“At Kearney. We’ll be there in about an hour.
You can get off and stretch your legs, and so can the
dog.”</p>

<p>“Could I go back from Kearney?” Terry blurted.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” And the general’s eyes twinkled.
“You aren’t homesick already, are you? You might
have to wait there until two o’clock in the morning,
for the passenger train. You could catch the same
train farther down the line. No; you’d better ride
on to Omaha, and see the whole system that you’ve
helped build.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” agreed Terry—but somehow he felt a
little doubtful. If he should be kept at Omaha, on
account of Indian trouble—oh, that wouldn’t do at all.
His place was at the front.</p>

<p>Kearney had been named for old Fort Kearney,
across the river. It wasn’t much of a place, yet: just
the station and a store and scattering of small houses.
There were several soldiers from the fort standing
around. General Dodge and Superintendent Reed
had jumped off and seemed to be having business with
an officer, while the engine took on water; so Terry
and Shep jumped off, too. Then a man came running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
from the station door, with a piece of yellow paper—a
telegram—for the engineer.</p>

<p>He was a lively young man, with a limp. Staring,
Terry scarcely could believe his eyes. Now he, too,
ran, yelling, and Shep bolted ahead, barking, and they
caught the young man, who turned, astonished.</p>

<p>Yes, it was Harry Revere, all right—good old
Harry, ex-school teacher, ex-Pike’s Peaker, ex-prospector,
ex-Pony Express rider, ex-Overland Stage station-keeper,
and a dandy partner.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, what you doing here?” he demanded,
as they shook hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m traveling special, inspecting the U. P.,”
grinned Terry. “What you doing?”</p>

<p>“I’m the boss lightning-shooter at this shebang,”
proclaimed Harry. “You couldn’t travel at all, if it
wasn’t for me. See? Wait till I deliver this dispatch.”</p>

<p>In a moment he came back.</p>

<p>“Thought you were somewhere down the line
farther; thought you were in Omaha, maybe,” said
Terry.</p>

<p>“So I was, but I’m getting promoted out toward the
front. That’s where I want to be. I won’t stop till
I’m clear through to Salt Lake. But where you going?
Thought you had a job at the front, yourself?
How’s Jenny? [Jenny really was Harry’s mule, but
she was working for the company.] How are your
folks?”</p>

<p>“They’re all right. So’s Jenny. Jimmie Muldoon’s
brother is riding her and spelling me. I’m going to
Omaha. General Dodge invited me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“You haven’t quit?”</p>

<p>“No. I’m just on a little trip.”</p>

<p>“What do you want to go on to Omaha for?”
scolded Harry. “Shucks! This is no time to take
it easy, when we’re trying to make a big year. I want
to be at the front, myself. There’s nothing between
here and Omaha. Where’s George?”</p>

<p>“He’s on survey, ’way out.”</p>

<p>“Wish I was with him,” asserted Harry. “But
I’m getting along, by hops and skips. I don’t savvy
why you want to go to Omaha, when you were at the
front, yourself, with Jenny.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go, Harry,” Terry confessed.
“Gee, I’d like to be back already. General Dodge
has asked me, though; I guess he thinks it’s a treat for
me to ride to Omaha. I’m sick of loafing—I’ve
been gone a night and half a day, now, and I ought
to be back, in case they need me.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you,” Harry praised. “I’ll tell you:
You stop off here with me, for a couple of hours. You
can explain to the general that you’d rather stay and
visit me than go on to Omaha. You won’t have to
wait for the passenger train. No, sir! I’ll fix you
out.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask him,” answered Terry, on the run again.</p>

<p>The general seemed to understand perfectly.</p>

<p>“You see, sir,” Terry finished, “I’d like to be on the
job till you come through next time, and then maybe
I can get off to go out on that survey trip, if you have
room for me. I’d rather find George Stanton than
go to Omaha. I like the front, and I’ve seen a whole
lot of the road, now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“That’s all right,” General Dodge approved. “The
front’s the best place. You stay there, and keep your
share of the rails moving up. We can’t run trains
without rails, and unless we have the rails we can’t get
to Salt Lake and beat the Central. So good-by and
good luck. I’ll have a wire sent to your father that
you’ve turned back.”</p>

<p>“Please tell him to tell Pat Miles that I’ll be there
tomorrow morning sure, and I’ll want my mule and
truck,” Terry begged.</p>

<p>The general laughed. He and Mr. Reed boarded
their train and it pulled out. Terry and Shep found
Harry Revere in the operator’s room of the passenger
station—which also was the station-agent’s room.</p>

<p>“What do you have to do, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. I only sell tickets and check up
freight and bill express and send dispatches and read
the wire and wrestle baggage and sweep out and answer
questions and once in a while tend some woman’s
baby while she goes home after something she’s forgotten.
When there’s nothing more important, I eat
or sleep. But I’m hoping to push on up front, where
it’s lively. I aim to get to Salt Lake as soon as the
rails and poles do. Were you in that Injun fracas at
end o’ track, yesterday?”</p>

<p>“I shore was. How’d you hear?”</p>

<p>“I picked it off the wire. I just sat here and made
medicine while you-all fought. Nobody scalped, was
there? Did they hurt Jenny? I asked the North
Platte operator and he laughed at me. ‘Ha, ha!’ was
all he said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Nope; nobody scalped, except a couple of the
Sioux. They put a hole through Jenny’s ear, though.”</p>

<p>“The low-down villains!” grumbled Harry.
“Abused the beautiful ear of my Jenny, did they?
When I come along I’ll bring her an earring. Reckon
a little bale of hay would please her most: an earring
to represent a little bale of hay. And a cob of corn
for the other ear, if she gets a hole through that too.
Say,” he asked, “you didn’t see Sol Judy in those parts,
did you?”</p>

<p>“No. Is Sol around there?”</p>

<p>“Yep. He’s a scout at Fort McPherson, helping
guard the line.” That was good news. Sol Judy was
another old friend. He dated away back to the Kansas
ranch, where he’d appeared on his way from California.
And he’d been with them in the Colorado gold diggin’s,
and had driven stage and scouted along the Overland;
and now here he was again, still doing his share of
work while the country grew.</p>

<p>“Our whole family’s joining in with the U. P., looks
like,” Harry added.</p>

<p>“All except my mother and George’s mother and
Virgie.” Virgie was George Stanton’s sister. “And
I bet you they’ll be on the job some way, before we get
done with it.”</p>

<p>“You win,” Harry chuckled. “That’s their style—right
up and coming. Well, let’s go to dinner.
How’d you like fried ham and saleratus biscuits?”</p>

<p>“Fine.”</p>

<p>“Good. Yesterday I had saleratus biscuits and
fried ham, today we’ll have fried ham and saleratus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
biscuits; tomorrow there’ll be just biscuits and ham.
It’s a great system.”</p>

<p>They ate in the section house, at a board table
covered with oilcloth. After dinner they swapped
yarns and visited, while Harry busied himself dispatching
or attending to the people who dropped in. A
passenger train from the west came through, and a
freight.</p>

<p>About three o’clock Harry took another message,
and reported on it.</p>

<p>“Now you can get out of here. There’ll be a freight
along in about half an hour.” That was welcome
news.</p>

<p>“From the east, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Hooray,” Terry cheered. “I’ll be on the job
again in the morning.”</p>

<p>But Harry scowled as he jiggled his telegraph key.</p>

<p>“Dead once more,” he complained.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“The line west.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the operator up there’s asleep.”</p>

<p>“No. It’s lack of juice. I can tell. Something’s
busted.”</p>

<p>“Injuns did it, huh?”</p>

<p>“Naw, don’t think so. Ever since that buck tore
a wire out and tried to ride off with it, and lightning
struck the line a mile or so beyond and killed him
and his pony both, the Injuns have let the Talking
Spirit alone. ’Cept of course they shoot the insulators
off, now and then. And the Overlanders chop the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
poles for firewood and use a piece of wire when they
want to fix their wagons. At least, they do that on
the other side the river, and I reckon they reach over
and do it on this side. And the poles make mighty
fine scratch sticks for the buffalo to rub against.”</p>

<p>The Overland Telegraph Company’s line across continent
followed the stage road, south of the Platte;
the Union Pacific Railroad line followed the rails on
this side of the river. But when the railroad was
finished, there would likely be only the one line.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” Terry asked.</p>

<p>“Find Bill Thompson. The break’s between here
and Willow.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Bill Thompson?”</p>

<p>“Head lineman. He’ll have to get out and fix it.
You stay here and keep shop while I hunt Bill.”</p>

<p>“Supposing the freight comes along,” queried
Terry. “Do I jump it?”</p>

<p>“Nary a jump,” Harry answered, from the door.
“Let her come. She dassn’t run through without
orders from the boss, and that’s Harry Revere, chief
lightning-shooter, station-agent, ticket-seller, express-toter,
freight-slinger, baggage-wrecker and baby-tender.
I’ll be back and tell ’em what to do.”</p>

<p>He was gone about twenty minutes, and returned
considerably flustered.</p>

<p>“Bill’s fishing. Dog-gone him! He never catches
anything, either. He went up the Platte or down the
Platte; left word he was going down, so probably he’s
up. Now traffic on the Union Pacific Railroad will
have to wait on Bill. I’ve got people hunting him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>The freight pulled in. The engine stood fuming;
the crew lolled about; yes, everything and everybody
waited on Bill Thompson. Terry felt that he was
losing valuable time. This was pretty tough. He
wanted to be on his way.</p>

<p>Bill appeared, breathless, at half-past four—and he
hadn’t caught a single fish, either. Now he had to
get his men together and his handcar out.</p>

<p>“How far’s he going?” Terry demanded, struck
with an idea.</p>

<p>“As far as Willow, anyway. North Platte, maybe,
if he takes the notion,” said Harry. “There’s better
fishing at North Platte—and better eating, too. Besides,
he’s got a girl up there, at an all-night hash
counter.”</p>

<p>“Gee, then! Why can’t Shep and I go too?” Terry
proposed.</p>

<p>“Sure thing. There’s nothing like a handcar, for
seeing the country from. Climb aboard. Tell Bill I
sent you.”</p>

<p>“But won’t the freight pass us?”</p>

<p>“Not till you get to Willow. It’ll have to wait till
Bill gives the O. K. These freights are mighty uncertain—they’re
strictly limited. When they don’t
happen to be moving they’re standing still, waiting for
something. The main business of a freight crew on
this line seems to be hunting a side-track. So if you’re
really in a hurry you’d better take the handcar.”</p>

<p>“All right. Good-by.” And Terry ran for the
handcar.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you at Salt Lake,” called Harry, after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>The handcar crew were about ready. They
numbered four, in broad-brimmed slouch hats, flannel
shirts, and trousers tucked into heavy boots. They
were just stowing their climbing irons and other tools
on the car, and a couple of rifles, also.</p>

<p>Bill Thompson, the red-faced head lineman, with
whiskers on his chin, granted Terry a sharp look.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, bub?”</p>

<p>“Harry said I could go up track with you, if you
don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“An’ the dawg too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, please.”</p>

<p>“An’ ’ow fur might you be goin’?” By his speech
Bill was English.</p>

<p>“Clear to North Platte, if I can. I’ve got a job
with the track-laying gang at end o’ track.”</p>

<p>“You ’ave, ’ave you? H’all right. H’aint afraid
o’ h’Injuns, h’are you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Needn’t be scared of Injuns, boy,” remarked one
of the other men, as Terry and Shep hopped aboard
together. “They don’t bother the track. These here
guns are for antelope. You sit at one end, out of
the way, and hold your dog where he won’t be stepped
on.”</p>

<p>With a running start they were off. Harry waved
from the station door.</p>

<p>Shep lay braced, considerably astonished; but he
was a wise old dog, and put his trust in his master.
Terry sat with his legs hanging over the rear end of
the car; the men, two to a bar, pumped regularly; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
car gathered way, and moved clanking over the rails.
This assuredly beat riding upon a train, because a
fellow was right outdoors and could see everywhere.</p>

<p>It was sort of go-as-you-please, too. The men kept
close watch of the telegraph line; now and then they
stopped the car, and one of them put on his climbing
irons and shinned up a pole, to inspect. But they
didn’t find the break, yet. Meanwhile the sun sank
lower and lower, and presently entered a bank of clouds
in the west. Dusk began to gather; the plains seemed
very quiet and lonely, and the handcar small and lost.</p>

<p>What with the frequent stops, to investigate, darkness
was making everything dim when they rolled into
Plum Creek station. Plum Creek was as lonely as the
country around; the station was locked and the agent
evidently had gone for the night.</p>

<p>“’E wouldn’t know h’anything, any’ow,” remarked
Bill Thompson. “’E h’ain’t a h’operator.”</p>

<p>They bowled on, through Plum Creek, and into the
darkness.</p>

<p>“’Ow’s a man expected to see a broken wire this
time o’ day?” Bill grumbled.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t day; it’s night.”</p>

<p>“Right you h’are,” he answered. “We’ll go h’on
to Willow an’ find out if h’anybody there knows h’anything.
An’ when we’re at Willow we’re ’alf way to
North Platte, aye? Might as well go on to North
Platte, aye? H’are you game? North Platte’s a
proper kind o’ place. ’Bout time this line was inspected
clear through, h’anyway. Climb a pole, one
o’ you, an’ test out. We’re liable to pass that break
unbeknown.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>With a torch, one of the men climbed a pole.</p>

<p>“I can raise ’em east, but I can’t get ’em, west,” he
called down. “The break’s on ahead still. I see a
light, ’way up track.”</p>

<p>“What kind o’ light?”</p>

<p>“First I thought it was a train a-comin’. Doesn’t
seem to move, though. It’s ’round a curve. You
fellers on the ground can’t see it.”</p>

<p>“Trampers, maybe.”</p>

<p>“Or the h’operator from Willow is tryin’ to fix
that break ’imself,” added Bill. “Come down an’ we’ll
go h’up.”</p>

<p>So the man came down from the pole, and the handcar
moved on, pump-pump, clank-clank, with everybody
peering ahead.</p>

<p>Yes, after a time they could glimpse the light, before,
where the track led. It flickered ruddily, but did
not move. Looked to be a bonfire.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any figgers at it,” said one of the men.</p>

<p>“They must be workin’ on the wire,” said Bill.
“Or else layin’ an’ toastin’ their shins.”</p>

<p>“You don’t reckon it’s Injuns, do you?”</p>

<p>“What’d h’Injuns be doin’ with a big fire to show
their whereabouts?” Bill reproved. “H’anyway, ’ere
we come.”</p>

<p>The distance lessened, and the bonfire grew plainer.
It was a hundred yards before, on the curve—it was
seventy-five yards—it was fifty yards; the handcar
had slackened, while everybody gazed curiously; and
suddenly, as if out of the very ground, there had
sprung into ruddy view on both sides of the track a
dozen figures, ahorse and afoot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>Bill yelped alarmed.</p>

<p>“H’Injuns, boys! Don’t stop. Give it to her!
We’ll run right through ’em!”</p>

<p>The men bowed their backs. The handcar fairly
jumped as it charged the fire and the figures. Hanging
hard and squirming flat, Terry held his breath.
A moment more, and ’midst a chorus of yells they
were there, running the gauntlet. Then, to a violent
crash, they and the car were hurtling together, high
in the air.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE CHEYENNES HAVE SOME FUN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a terrific jar Terry landed far in the brush and
went ploughing and rolling, topsy-turvy. He thought
that he heard Shep yelp (as if Shep had landed, too,
somewhere); then he brought up, in a heap, wedged
at the bottom of a little wash.</p>

<p>He lay without moving, listening and wondering
if any bones were broken. No; he seemed to be all
right. But there were chases, through the brush, in
the darkness; the Indians were riding hither-thither,
shouting and shooting. He heard it all—the shots,
the yells of triumph, a groan or two. The Indians
were killing the handcar men!</p>

<p>It seemed to him a long time before that was over
with, and every moment he expected an Indian to ride
on top of him. But the yelling and shooting and
scurrying died away. The Indians appeared to be
gathering at their fire.</p>

<p>Ah! What was that? He heard a faint rustle,
near him. An Indian was scouting about, on foot,
looking for him? He scarcely dared to breathe as
he hugged the earth, and his heart thumped like a drum.
Then something paused, beside him; next something
cold, like a knife blade, pressed against his neck, and
he heard a little whimper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>It was Shep, and Shep’s nose! Shep was alive and
had found him. Oh, Shep! Good old Shep! Be
quiet, Shep. But Shep knew. He was satisfied, and
crouched close, only once in a while growling low in his
throat.</p>

<p>Here they were—the only ones left alive, Terry
felt, from the handcar. Now what could he do? The
Indians were talking and laughing, at a little distance.
He gradually untangled himself, and inch by inch
raised his head, to see, in the direction of the fire. He
had to crawl a few feet, to the edge of his wash. He
peeped over.</p>

<p>The Indians were collected around their fire, beside
the track. Between his place and the fire there was
a narrow gully, bridged by a wooden culvert; and upon
the track over the culvert there was a tie, fastened to
the rails by wire, but knocked askew. That was what
the handcar had struck; and he had been thrown clear
across to this side and luckily had landed in this wash
cut diagonally by the rains. The sage was quite high
here, too. He guessed he hadn’t been counted on the
handcar, because he had been lying down and the four
men had been standing.</p>

<p>He could just see the handcar, bottomside up, in
the brush on the slope of the gully. Now the Indians
were leaving their fire and trooping down track a little
way. They began to pry at the rails, with poles.
They were planning another wreck. This one had
been a success, but it was only a small one. Perhaps
they thought that a tie would not wreck a train, and
they wanted to wreck a train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>They pried and worked, loosening the rails. What
could a fellow do? That freight at Kearney might
have got tired of waiting, and be along any time. Or
a passenger train might come. Terry thought upon
breaking for Willow Island, to give the alarm there.
No, that wouldn’t be the quickest way. If he might
only get around the Indians, and run to Plum Creek—it
couldn’t be more than five or six miles, and he
might meet the train this side of it and stop it, somehow.</p>

<p>“Whisht! Come on, Shep. Careful, now,” he
whispered. He started to crawl. Shep crawled behind
him. Once down in the gully, maybe they could
follow it up a way, and make a circuit around that
gang. They reached the bottom, and were about to
do finely, when Terry heard a groan.</p>

<p>It sounded from the brush, beyond the gully. He
listened, and heard it again. It was a groan in
English. One of the handcar men was alive. Well,
he ought to go and see.</p>

<p>“’Elp!”</p>

<p>That was Bill Thompson! Bill was groaning for
help. Oh, dear!</p>

<p>Up he crawled, seeking the place of the groans.</p>

<p>“Hello! Where are you?” he asked, cautiously.
He was almost into the fire-light.</p>

<p>“’Ere. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Terry Richards. I’m coming.”</p>

<p>He kept crawling, and pretty soon he found Bill
lying flat on his side, with his head on his arm. In
the faint glimmer of the flames a ghastly thing he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“You bad hurt, Bill?”</p>

<p>“’Ello. They shot me through the h’arm an’ knifed
me in the neck an’ scalped me, but I got the scalp.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Yes. ’Ere ’tis, in my ’and. The bloomin’ beggar
didn’t ’ang onto h’it. ’E dropped h’it. H’I saw ’im.
Felt like the ’ole top o’ my ’ead was h’off, but I got
h’it when they wasn’t lookin’. D’ you think h’it’ll
grow on me again?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. We’d better get right out of here,
though. He may come looking for it.”</p>

<p>“’E ’asn’t missed it, I reckon. H’it was in ’is belt.
What they doin’ now?”</p>

<p>“Tearing up the rails, so as to wreck a train. I’m
going to try to make Plum Creek. I’ll help you into
that gully; then I’ve got to go.”</p>

<p>“H’all right,” groaned Bill. “You go. Never you
mind me. H’I can manage.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Terry. And suddenly he crouched
lower. “Keep quiet, Bill. They’re coming back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the bloody villains,” groaned Bill. “Make a
run for it, while you can. Never mind me.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” answered Terry. And even if he would,
he didn’t dare. They might see him; if they didn’t
catch him, they’d find Bill——!</p>

<p>The whole body of Indians were roistering back, up
track, for their fire; probably to hide near it, as before,
and wait. Some were afoot, some on ponies;
and a hideous sight they offered, to Terry, crouched
here on the outskirts of the fire-light, and daring to
move not a muscle. Cheyennes; that’s who they were:
Cheyennes!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>They began to scatter out, for ambush. Perhaps
there’d be a chance to risk it and crawl farther away.
Ah! Oh, thunder! One of them was coming across,
straight this way, prowling through the brush.</p>

<p>“Lie low, Bill. Watch sharp.”</p>

<p>“What’s doin’?”</p>

<p>“They’re at the fire, but one of ’em’s coming.”</p>

<p>“’E’s lookin’ for ’is scalp,” Bill groaned.</p>

<p>They stiffened, motionless. Shep growled, and
Terry nudged him frantically. The Indian—he had
feathers in his braids and a gun in his hands—ranged
right and left, and all the time drew nearer. At that
rate, he couldn’t miss them—not if he kept on. Terry
didn’t know whether to bolt or to stay. If Shep only
would quit that growling——! Or if the Indian
would only turn aside. To be shot, or tomahawked,
would be awful. It took a great deal of nerve to
stiffen, here, and hold one’s breath, and wait and pray.
There was just the chance that they wouldn’t be discovered—but
the Indian was coming, coming, in sure
and easy fashion, looking for that scalp!</p>

<p>Quit it, Shep! Bill was gasping, in his efforts to
utter no sound. It was worse for him, because he
couldn’t see. Terry could see, with the corner of an
eye, through the brush—and he’d about made up his
mind that at the last moment he would bolt, and run,
dodging, for the open. He’d have to risk a bullet,
and have to risk being overhauled; but he might get
away, and that would lead the Indian from Bill, too.
There wasn’t any use in the both of them being found,
in this one spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>He was all braced, to make his dive, when on a
sudden Shep took matters into his own hand. The
Indian was scouting about, in the brush not more than
twenty yards before—and out Shep charged, with a
furious snarly rush, in defense.</p>

<p>Terry had no time in which to grab him; and it
would have been too late, anyway. An instant more—so
brief a space that the Indian was taken by surprise—and
out from the brush Shep had sprung for
his throat. He knocked the Indian backward. They
staggered around together, Shep snarling and snapping,
the Cheyenne fighting him off. Terry half sat up, to
watch, his heart in his throat.</p>

<p>“It’s my dog,” he panted, to Bill.</p>

<p>The Cheyenne seemed to have Shep by the neck or
jaw, and was thrusting with his other arm, stabbing
him. Shep yelped, snarlily. With a kick and a fling
the Cheyenne threw him aside; and as Shep pluckily
struggled to his feet and still snarling made for him
again, the Cheyenne quickly leveled rifle, and fired.</p>

<p>The bullet drove poor old Shep in a heap. He lay
black and lax, scarcely moving, except to lift his head,
and drop it. He had happened to land in a bare spot,
and Terry could see him plainly. Yes, he was dead.</p>

<p>Such a hot wrath surged into Terry’s brain and
to his very finger-tips that all he wanted now was a
chance at that Indian, himself. If he but had a gun—or
if he might grab the Indian by the legs, drag
him down, and get atop of him! Anything, so as to
avenge brave old Shep. For the moment Terry was
too hot to think of himself, or Bill, or anybody except
Shep, and that Cheyenne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>The Cheyenne stood over Shep, kicked him once or
twice, and then seemed about to come on again.
Terry crouched, tense and alert. Shep had not saved
them, after all. Too bad.</p>

<p>“Is ’e comin’?” murmured Bill. “’E killed the
dawg?”</p>

<p>“Sh!” warned Terry.</p>

<p>No! Hurrah! The Cheyenne stopped, and looked
back. The Indians by the fire had whooped to him,
and were disappearing. The Cheyenne turned and ran
for them.</p>

<p>“He’s going, Bill!” Terry gasped. “It’s the train.
That’s coming. I can see the headlight. Oh, Bill!”</p>

<p>Bill struggled, to see also. Afar down the track
there was a light, wavering and flashing, and they
could hear a dull rumble. Several of the mounted
Indians had dashed away, in that direction. The
others were scuttling and hiding.</p>

<p>“H’it’s the freight,” Bill groaned. “H’it’s the
freight that was at Kearney. Bully Brookes, ’e’s
h’engine driver, ’Enshaw, ’e’s the stoker. H’it’ll be a
smash, an’ we can’t ’elp it. Is your dawg killed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so. But if he hadn’t run out the
Cheyenne would have found us and we’d have been
killed, too.”</p>

<p>“’E was a good dawg, a sure-’nough ’ero. ’E
stopped the h’Injun, but we can’t stop that train.”</p>

<p>“There are two trains, Bill! I see another light,
’way behind the first one!”</p>

<p>“H’it’ll be plain murder,” Bill groaned. “An’ we
can’t do a thing. I wish you’d never found me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“I couldn’t have got there in time, anyway,” said
Terry.</p>

<p>The first light rapidly grew larger, the rumbling
increased. Terry stared, fascinated. He didn’t wish
to see, but somehow he had to. If Bully Brookes or
his fireman, Henshaw, only would discover the lifted
rails and stop, in time, themselves. But it did not
seem as though they were going to stop or slacken.
Flaring and wavering, the headlight was coming on.</p>

<p>The engine began to whistle madly, with long shriek
after long shriek. Had it sensed its danger? But it
did not slacken—it was coming faster. And see!
The Cheyennes were nagging it; by the glare from the
opened firebox as the fireman shoved in the cordwood
sticks the Indians were shown, racing on either
side, brandishing their bows and guns, egging the
train on.</p>

<p>The engine jetted steam from its cylinder cocks;
the whistle shrieked and shrieked; the firebox glowed
redly as the firemen stoked with the cordwood, the
Indians lashed their ponies and plied their arrows. It
was a wild scene, and terrible. Terry trembled with
excitement. Bill sank back, groaning.</p>

<p>“Tell me when she ’its,” he pleaded.</p>

<p>The engine was approaching the bonfire. It had
not reached the tilted rails, yet. Oh, would nobody
see them?</p>

<p>They were seen, they were seen! Listen! The
notes of the whistle had changed to frantic yaps
like those of a frightened animal. “Down brakes,
down brakes, quick!” the whistle was imploring. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
engine wheels spurted sparks, under reversed throttle.
Too late. The racing Cheyennes swerved apart, for
safety; even while Terry gazed, and before he had time
to close his eyes, the engine rose right into the air,
with a roar and a plunge left the track, and dragging
the tender and car after car it went lurching into the
prairie.</p>

<p>It toppled over, cars toppled, and in a moment everything
seemed to be piled in a long heap. The engine
was almost buried from sight. Out of the jangle
there welled shouts. From the rear, men came running;
from the front the Cheyennes charged. One
man with a lantern—the conductor, maybe—arrived
at the fore; the Indians seemed to miss him, in
the excitement, for he turned and ran fast, again, down
track, throwing his lantern away. He was going to
the train behind, and it looked as though he got off,
safe.</p>

<p>The Cheyennes chased about, circled the engine
heap, and danced and whooped. Flames burst forth,
licking up through the heap, and the scene grew
brighter and brighter.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better move, Bill,” Terry stammered.
“They’ll see us here, sure, as soon as the train gets to
burning. We can hide in the little gully where I was.”</p>

<p>“H’all right,” Bill groaned. “H’it’s a good time,
while they’re murderin’ somebody h’else.”</p>

<p>That was a hard journey, with Bill hitching painfully
through the brush, using one arm and carrying
his scalp and stopping every little while to rest and
pant. The wonder was, that he could move at all—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
man who had been shot and stabbed and scalped;
but he had a lot of will power, and was determined to
live and make the scalp grow on his head again, “to
fool them bloody h’Injuns.”</p>

<p>At last he was settled in the gully, with Terry’s coat
under his head. Terry crawled up to the edge again,
to lie shivering, and see what more occurred. It wasn’t
very likely, though, that the Indians would leave the
wreck until they had to.</p>

<p>No, they stayed there. One or two of the cars following
the engine and tender had been loaded with
brick. They had landed right on top of the engine,
and the bricks were scattered all around. The Indians
were pelting the heap with the loose bricks; they
acted like children; but pretty soon the fire got too
hot for that, so they withdrew, to squat in a circle,
and curiously watch.</p>

<p>The second train had backed down track, and was
far distant, still backing. Had gone to Plum Creek,
probably, for help. Shivering Terry and groaning
Bill Thompson were left alone, with the Indians and
the blazing wreck. What a night! When would help
come?</p>

<p>Terry never forgot this night. Up the track, and
down the track beyond the wreck nothing moved.
The Indians stretched out and seemed to sleep comfortably
in the warmth of their big fire, as if waiting
until morning. In the gully Bill now and then
groaned. On the edge of the gully Terry huddled
and nodded—but whenever he started to doze, he
woke with a jump, seeing things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Poor old Shep! He had Shep in his mind a great
deal. Yes, Shep was a hero, and he should not be
left there, for the coyotes to eat. That would not
be fair.</p>

<p>“H’are you ’ere?” Bill called up, faintly. “’Ello,
lad.”</p>

<p>“I’m here,” Terry answered. “I’ll stay with you,
Bill. I’m going to stay till people come. I want to
bury my dog.”</p>

<p>“’E was a fine dawg,” Bill agreed.</p>

<p>Finally Terry did manage to sleep, in spite of his
shivering and his bad dreams. He awakened stiff and
bewildered. Where was he? Oh, yes; here in the
brush, still, outside the wreck. He might see about
him. The air was thin and gray, morning had come.
He cautiously raised higher, to look. The wreck was
smoking, the Indians were there—they were moving
about, and flocking down track, and climbing over
the cars. No rescue had come yet. Oh, dear! The
telegraph wires had been used, for tying the tie that
wrecked the handcar, to the track, but why didn’t help
come from Plum Creek way?</p>

<p>Was Bill dead? No, he spoke.</p>

<p>“’Ello?”</p>

<p>“Hello. How are you?”</p>

<p>“Wish I had a drink. What’s doin’ now?”</p>

<p>“They’re robbing the wreck.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what,” groaned Bill.</p>

<p>The Indians were enjoying themselves. They had
broken into some cars loaded with drygoods, and were
strewing the stuff right and left. As the morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
brightened, that was an odd sight, down there. The
Cheyennes wrapped themselves in gay calico and gingham
and red flannel and other cloths; they tied whole
bolts of the same cloth to their saddle horns and their
ponies’ tails, and darted hither-thither over the plain,
while the bolts unrolled and other riders chased after,
trying to step on the long streamers. They had so
much plunder that they seemed crazy.</p>

<p>Suddenly they all galloped to one side, to a little
rise, and gathered there, like a flock of magpies, gazing
up track. Had they seen Terry? He felt a thrill
of fear, and huddled lower. Then he bethought to
look behind, up track, too—and he saw smoke!</p>

<p>It was a train! A train was coming, from the
west. And how it did come! A rescue train!
Hurrah!</p>

<p>“Bill! A train’s coming! The Injuns are quitting!”</p>

<p>“Where from?”</p>

<p>“Up track.”</p>

<p>“’Ow’d they get word, thereabouts?”</p>

<p>“I dunno; but it’s coming, and coming lickity-split,
as if it had soldiers.”</p>

<p>“’Ooray!” Bill groaned. “An’ I ’ope it ’as a
doctor, to stick this ’ere scalp on me again.”</p>

<p>The engine shrieked, and the smoke poured blacker.
The Indians were getting restless. Then away they
scoured. Terry stood up and yelled and waved his
arms, the train—a short train of box-cars—pulled
in and soldiers tumbled out. How good their blue
coats looked! Terry went stumbling and staggering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
to meet them. He saw somebody he knew—the scout
in buckskin who was leading the soldiers, with the
officer.</p>

<p>“Sol! Hello, Sol Judy! Oh, Sol!”</p>

<p>But Sol scarcely knew <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>“Who are you? What? For heaven’s sake, boy!
You aren’t Terry Richards?”</p>

<p>“Guess I am.” And Terry sank down. His legs
had given out. “Oh, Sol! They wrecked our handcar,
and Bill Thompson’s in that gully with his scalp
gone, but he’s alive, and they killed Shep and then they
wrecked the freight and killed a lot more.”</p>

<p>In a moment he was surrounded and picked up.
He had to tell his story all over again, while some examined
the wreck, and some got Bill and carried him
up, and the Cheyennes meanwhile made off.</p>

<p>They were soldiers from Fort McPherson, beyond
Willow. A man had ridden around the Indians, from
Plum Creek, and taken the word.</p>

<p>“There aren’t enough of us to follow those fellows,”
explained Sol. “But the Pawnees are on the
way from end o’ track. They’ll do the business. Now
you and Thompson can go back with this train.”</p>

<p>“I want to bury Shep, first,” Terry pleaded.</p>

<p>“Sure you do. He died fighting, like a soldier,
and ‘Killed in action’ is the report on him. A good
U. P. hand he was, wasn’t he? So we’ll just bury
him right here, where he can watch the tracks.”</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to blame Terry any for crying,
when he and Sol and a couple of soldiers put Shep
away. Sol understood; he had known Shep a long
time, himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>The bodies of the handcar men and a brakeman
(the engineer and fireman had been burned) were
placed aboard, for Willow. Taking Bill Thompson
and Terry, but leaving the soldiers on guard at the
wreck, the train backed up track. Bill’s scalp had
been stowed in a bucket of water, to keep it limber.
It curled about, as it floated, and looked exactly like
a drowned rat. No doctor ever did succeed in planting
it and making it grow again on Bill’s head; but
Bill got well and went to work, wearing a skull-cap.</p>

<p>However, Terry went to work, the first, at end o’
track once more, the next morning. Jenny was glad
to see him. His father had been mighty glad, too,
and together they mourned the brave Shep.</p>

<p>“I hear tell ye lost your dog,” said Paddy Miles,
kindly.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” Terry answered, with a gulp.</p>

<p>“Ah, well; ’twas a bad night, sure enough, for him
an’ you an’ them others,” mused Pat. “But him an’
they are not the only wans. There’s many a grave
beside the U. Pay., behind us, an’ there’s more on ahead
an’ more yet to be made, before the road goes through.
’Tis a big job an’ a cruel job an’ a long road to travel;
but ’tis sich a job as is worth the dyin’ for anny day,
say I—though I’d fair like to live jist to see the
Cintral baten into Salt Lake an’ the U. Pay. track
stretchin’ out clane across Nevady.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>MOVING DAY ALONG THE LINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> marched the rails of the iron trail, at a giant’s
stride of one to two miles in a day, as if trying to
catch the tie-layers and the graders. But the tie-layers,
planting their ties every two feet, managed
to hold the advance; and twenty, thirty, fifty miles in
advance of them, the graders followed the stakes of
the engineers. Back and forth along the grade toiled
the wagons, distributing ties and provisions. From
Omaha to North Platte thundered the trains, bringing
fresh supplies, other rails and other ties, to be
taken on by the construction-trains.</p>

<p>And into Omaha were pouring, by boat up from
St. Louis and St. Joe, and by wagon from Iowa, still
other rails and ties and provisions, from the farther
east. It was said that if a double line of dollar bills
were laid, instead of rails, from Omaha across the
plains, they would not pay for the cost of the roadbed
alone.</p>

<p>The Indians were still bad. They had not given
up. They ambushed grading parties whenever they
could—killed stragglers and hunters, and ran off
stock. The Pawnee scouts and the regular cavalry and
infantry constantly patrolled the right-of-way, camped
with the men, and tried to clear the country, before
and on either side. But the construction-trains sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
fought at full speed, or narrowly escaped a wreck.</p>

<p>Every morning the track-layer gang of the boarding-train
piled out at reveille, the same as in the army;
they marched to work, in columns of fours, at a
shoulder arms, under captains and sergeants, stacked
their guns, and were ready to spring to ranks again
at the first order.</p>

<p>“B’ gorry, the same as a battalion o’ infantry, we
are,” said Pat Miles. “An’ there was no better battalion
durin’ the war, either. From Gin’ral Casement
down to the chief spiker we got as good officers as
ever wore the blue, wid five years’ trainin’ behind ’em—an’
there’s many a man usin’ a pick who’s fit to
command a company, in a pinch.”</p>

<p>Little was heard from the engineering parties in the
field. They were scattered all through the mountains,
from up in Wyoming down into Colorado, and on
across into Utah, beyond Salt Lake. In fact, last
year the surveys for the best routes had been pushed
clear to California—so as to be ready.</p>

<p>The parties that had come in, in the winter, to report
and draw their maps, had gone out again in
early spring for another season’s work. Some of the
parties even had stayed out all winter, measuring the
snow falls and learning the weather at the passes.</p>

<p>General Sherman, commanding this Military Division
of the Missouri, which extended from the Mississippi
River to the Rocky Mountains, had issued
orders that the military posts should furnish General
Dodge with all the soldiers who might be spared, so that
the road and the survey parties should be protected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>Just the same, the surveying job was a dangerous
job; ten and twelve miles of the survey lines were run,
each day, and the chain-men and rod-men sometimes
were far separated from the soldiers—and the chief
of the party was supposed to go in the advance, to discover
the easiest country.</p>

<p>Last year the mountains and the deserts on either
slope had been pretty well covered. Now it was understood
that the road was not to turn south for Denver
and the Colorado Rockies—no good passes had been
found; it was to turn for the northwest, instead, and
cross the Rockies in Wyoming, by a pass that General
Dodge himself had discovered in one of his Indian
campaigns two years ago.</p>

<p>So onward marched the rails—that double line ever
reaching westward. Back and forth, hauling the
truck, Terry rode old yellow Jenny—and how many
miles he traveled, to every one mile of track, he never
quite figured out, but seemed to him that he already
had ridden the distance to San Francisco.</p>

<p>“We’ll be after changin’ the base to a new Julesburg—as
soon as the rails reach yon,” said the men.</p>

<p>“Sure, if it’s base o’ supplies ye mane, that’ll be
changed before ever the rails get there,” was the answer.
“Any day now they’ll be comin’ through—wid
their gin mills an’ their skin-games an’ all on
wheels, to be set up an’ waitin’ for our pay-car.”</p>

<p>And that was true. The railroad followed up along
the north side of the South Platte River. The Overland
Stage road followed up along the south side,
with the six-horse teams and the round Concord stages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
plying over it between North Platte and Denver, on
the Salt Lake haul. And stage road and railroad
grade headed westward toward the old stage station
at Julesburg.</p>

<p>It seemed likely that a new Julesburg would be the
next supply base. It was about the right distance
from North Platte, the last base, or ninety miles; for
about every ninety or one hundred miles the supply
base was relocated, farther along, at end o’ track.</p>

<p>Sure enough. The middle of June, when old Julesburg
itself was in sight, two or three miles before,
on the south side of the river there appeared a long
procession of wagons, buggies, horses, mules, men,
women and children.</p>

<p>“B’ gorry! Here they come, an’ there they go.
Ain’t they kind, though, to be all waitin’ for us?”</p>

<p>The wagons were loaded high with canvas, lumber,
and goods; men and women were perched atop, or
riding in buggies, or upon saddle-animals. The procession
looked like a procession of refugees from a
war—there must have been over two hundred people.
They certainly raised a great cloud of dust.</p>

<p>The track-gang paused to cheer and wave; the
women and the men waved back. The graders on
ahead waved and cheered, as the procession passed
them, to ford the river again at old Julesburg and
wait for end o’ track.</p>

<p>But Paddy Miles, the rugged Irishman, growled
indignant.</p>

<p>“Bad cess to the likes of ’em. ’Tis hell on wheels,
ag’in, movin’ on to ruin many a man amongst us.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
Sure, if the Injuns’d only sweep the whole lot from
the face o’ the trail, I’d sing ‘Glory be! There’s
a use for the red nagurs, after all.’”</p>

<p>The way these new towns sprang up was wonderful.
The railroad sort of sowed them—and they
grew over night like Jonah’s gourd or the bean-stalk
of Jack-the-Giant-Killer. There was North Platte.
Before the rails touched it, it had been nothing except
a prairie-dog village. But in three weeks it had blossomed
into a regular town.</p>

<p>Now part of its people were moving along, to tag
the pay-car. These were the saloon keepers, gamblers,
and speculators, in haste to fleece the railroad workers.
The track men and the graders got three dollars a day,
which meant rich picking for people bent upon selling
nothing for something.</p>

<p>The land agents of the railroad company had selected
the site for the next terminus town. Evidently it
was across from old Julesburg, for this evening lights
beamed out, in a great cluster, up the grade, where
the “Hell on Wheels,” as the wrathful Pat Miles
had dubbed it, was settling down like a fat spider
weaving a web.</p>

<p>In the morning there was revealed the tents set
up, and the board shanties going up—a mass of
whity-brown and dingy dun, squatted upon the gravelly
landscape on the railroad side of the river.</p>

<p>Several graders had been killed, in shooting scrapes;
the night at new Julesburg had been a wild one; the
track-layers who were anxious to spend their money
waxed impatient to arrive. As soon as the rails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
reached the sprawling tent-and-shanty town, on the
third day, the terminus supplies were moving up, on
flat-cars, from North Platte.</p>

<p>The big building used by Casement Brothers, the
contractors, occupied a car by itself. It could be taken
apart like a toy building of blocks or cardboard. All
the sections were numbered; and were unjointed, piled
upon a car, moved on, and set up again.</p>

<p>That was the case with a number of other buildings—stores
and offices, and the like. Some of them
were painted to look as though they had brick or stone
fronts—but they were only flimsy wood. Why, anybody
who wished to erect a home on a lot could buy
the house for $300 in Chicago, and have it shipped,
ready to be stuck together.</p>

<p>The railroad company owned the lands upon which
these terminal towns or “base” towns were located.
The company land agents sold or leased the town lots,
and the speculators who acquired the lots ran the figures
up as high as $1000.</p>

<p>The rails paused a few days at this new Julesburg,
while the supplies from North Platte were brought
up, and side-tracks were laid for switching. After
supper the first night in, Terry and little Jimmie, his
side-partner, went sight-seeing—like everybody else.</p>

<p>What a place—what an ugly, sprawling, dusty,
noisy place, of tents and shacks and jostling people,
flannel-shirted, booted track-layers and graders,
blanketed Mexicans, even a few Arapaho Indians, attracted
hither-thither by the shouts and songs and revolver
shots, while candles, lanterns and coal-oil lamps
tried to turn the dusk into day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“The man over there is yelling ‘Hurrah for the
wickedest town in America!’ Hear him?” half whispered
Jimmie.</p>

<p>“It’s a heap worse than North Platte ever was,”
Terry answered. “North Platte’s a division point
and will be a city; but Pat says this town won’t last
long. When the gamblers and whiskey-sellers move
on with the rails, there won’t be anything left.”</p>

<p>Suddenly he and Jimmie met, face to face, General
Dodge himself, with little General “Jack” Casement
and a party, two of them in military uniform. The
generals stopped short.</p>

<p>“What are you boys doing here?”</p>

<p>“Jist lookin’ ’round, sorrs,” stammered Jimmie, in
his best brogue, with scrape of foot and touch of fingers
to his ragged cap.</p>

<p>“You go back to the train. This is no place for
boys,” General Casement ordered sharply. “I think,”
he added, to General Dodge, “that I’ll instruct the
police to keep all minors off the streets, at night, unless
with their parents or guardians.”</p>

<p>“A good idea,” agreed General Dodge. “But I’ll
relieve you of one boy, anyway. He goes along with
me, I believe. You still want to go to the very front,
do you?” he asked, of Terry.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, if I can.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can, with General Casement’s permission.
I’m on my way now. My party is camped a
few miles out, beside the river. You’ll see the tents,
in the morning. And you’ll find an old friend of yours
with us: Sol Judy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>That was good news.</p>

<p>“Is Sol going? Do you know Sol, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. Sol’s been my guide before. He
mentioned you when we got to talking over the Plum
Creek massacre. That was a close call, wasn’t it!
And you lost your dog.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” faltered Terry, with a little twinge in
his heart. “I lost him. But he saved Bill Thompson
and me. I suppose losing those men was worse.”</p>

<p>“They all gave their lives to the service,” said the
general, gravely. “People will never know what it
costs to build this road and keep it open. Now, we
break camp at five o’clock tomorrow morning. You
report to me here at Casement Brothers’ headquarters
at six o’clock. Bring your campaign kit along, for
we’ll be out all summer. We’ll provide a horse for
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’ll be there,” Terry exclaimed, rejoicing.</p>

<p>“How about this other lad?” pursued the general,
a twinkle in his eye as he scanned the red-headed
Jimmie Muldoon. “Does he want to go out into the
Indian country?”</p>

<p>“No, sorr; plaze, sorr,” Jimmie apologized. “Sure,
we have plinty Injuns where we be, an’ I’ll stay wid
the Irish. Me father’s chief spiker, sorr, an’ me
mother washes clothes, an’ me brother’s water carrier
an’ I’ve another brother who’s like to have Terry’s
job; so it’s the Muldoon family that’ll see the end o’
track through to Salt Lake.”</p>

<p>“All right,” the general laughed. “Stay ‘wid the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Irish.’ You’ve a loyal corps, Casement. But both
you boys go back to your train and keep out of trouble.”</p>

<p>With Jimmie, Terry was glad enough to beat a retreat
to the boarding-train, set out a little way in the
cleaner brush and sand, where the air was pure and
the night was peaceful. A number of the men, also,
soon had enough of “town,” and were already turning
in, to sleep. But there was no sleep in new Julesburg.
All night the hubbub and hurly-burly continued,
in spite of the police stationed by General Casement.</p>

<p>However, tomorrow this would be left behind.
Many a mile yet into the north of west stretched the
grade, waiting for the rails; and beyond the grade itself
stretched the surveyors’ location stakes; and beyond
the line of location stakes stretched widely the
desert and the mountains, where other stakes were
being driven—and where Terry Richards was about to
explore, in company with Scout Sol Judy and no less
a personage than the bold General Dodge, chief engineer
of the whole road.</p>

<p>George Stanton, somewhere out there, having fun
while he chopped stakes and maybe even held the end
of a surveyor’s chain, was likely to get the surprise of
his life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>OUT INTO THE SURVEY COUNTRY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a tremendous large party. In fact, it looked
like a regular military excursion, instead of a survey
trip, when in the early morning it moved out
from new Julesburg (the “roaring town” was dead
tired at this hour) and headed northwest up Lodge
Pole Creek by the old Overland Stage road on the
Oregon Trail.</p>

<p>There were two companies, B and M, of the Second
Cavalry, from Fort McPherson, commanded by Captain
(or Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel) J. K. Mizner
and First Lieutenant James N. Wheelan, to ride the
country and guard the long train of supply wagons.
There was Surgeon Henry B. Terry, of the army
medical corps—a slender, black-moustached, active
man in major’s shoulder-straps. There were the
teamsters and farriers and wagoners and cooks and
what-not.</p>

<p>There were General Casement, and Construction
Superintendent Sam Reed, and Colonel Silas Seymour
of New York (the consulting engineer who was General
Dodge’s assistant), and Mr. T. J. Carter, a Government
director of the road, and Mr. Jacob Blickensderfer,
Jr., an engineer sent from Washington by the
President, and Mr. James Evans, the division engineer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
who was going out to examine the route to the base of
the Black Hills range. There were General William
Myers, chief quartermaster of the Department of the
Platte, who was to inspect the site of a new army post
on the railroad survey, and several surveyors who were
to take the places of men that had been killed by the
Indians.</p>

<p>And there was General Dodge’s own party, with
notables enough in it to make a boy feel rather small.</p>

<p>Of course, the tall, lean man in buckskin was Scout
Sol Judy, a real rider of the plains, always ready for
Indians or anything else. He knew the country from
Omaha to California.</p>

<p>The pleasant, full-bearded man who rode beside
General Dodge himself was none other than General
John A. Rawlins, chief-of-staff to General Grant, at
Washington. General Rawlins was not well, and General
Grant had asked General Dodge if he might not
be taken along, sometime, on a trip, to see if roughing
it in the Far West might not do him good. So here
he was. He and General Dodge had been noted commanders
in the Civil War, and were warm friends of
each other and of General Grant, too.</p>

<p>The alert trim-bearded man in corduroy coat
was Mr. David Van Lennep, the geologist, whose business
was to explore for coal-fields and minerals in the
path of the survey.</p>

<p>The tall heavy-set, round-faced boyish-looking man
was Captain and Major William McKee Dunn, General
Rawlins’ aide-de-camp, of the Twenty-first Infantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>Another round-faced boyish young man was Mr.
John R. Duff from Boston. His father was a director
of the railroad company.</p>

<p>The tall slim man with side-whiskers was Mr. John
E. Corwith, of Galena, Illinois, who was a guest of
General Rawlins.</p>

<p>For Terry to get the names and titles straight required
most of the day. General Dodge had introduced
him in bluff fashion: “Gentlemen, this is
Terry Richards, one of the company men who are laying
the rails across continent. He’ll be one of us, on
the trip.”</p>

<p>Beginning with General Rawlins, they all had shaken
hands with him. But it was young Mr. Duff who explained
who they were, as on his horse Terry fell in
behind, to bring up the rear.</p>

<p>That was the place chosen by Mr. Duff and Mr.
Corwith, the other civilian guest.</p>

<p>“So you’re out to see the country, too, are you?”
queried Mr. Duff, genially. “What are you? Track
inspector in advance?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Terry admitted, a little uneasy in
his faded old clothes. But clothes seemed to make
no difference. “General Dodge said I could be his
‘striker’—that means help around his tent, and General
Rawlins’ tent.”</p>

<p>“Heat the water for the bath, eh?” laughed Mr.
Corwith.</p>

<p>“Shucks! No, Corwith! Nobody bathes on a trip
like this,” retorted Mr. Duff. “Not unless we come
to some hot springs. After a while the water’ll be as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
cold as ice—right out of the snows. Isn’t that so,
Terry? Where’s your home town?”</p>

<p>“U. P. boarding-train, end o’ track,” promptly replied
Terry. “It’s a traveling town,” he explained.</p>

<p>“I should say so. Ever been out much farther in
this country?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’ve ridden on the stage part way to
Salt Lake.”</p>

<p>“That must have been a great trip. But think of
riding by railroad there! Whew! The stage took
about ten days, didn’t it? And the railroad’ll do it
in three! I was out to end o’ track last fall—on that
big excursion from the East and Omaha. We started
to go to the Hundreth Meridian, or 247 miles from
Omaha; but you fellows built so fast that we kept
going till we were thirty miles beyond.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. They all laid 260 miles of track in eight
months, last year. This year General Dodge and General
Casement want us to do 290, about. That’ll take
us over the top of the Black Hills mountains.”</p>

<p>“But what’ll they do without your help?” asked
Mr. Corwith, slyly.</p>

<p>“Aw, I don’t amount to much,” Terry informed,
for fear they might think he had bragged. “I just
ride a mule that hauls a truck-load of rails for the men
to lay.”</p>

<p>“Don’t the Indians bother?”</p>

<p>“Some,” admitted Terry. “They kill the men they
can catch. But they can’t whip the graders or track-layers
in a regular battle, though.”</p>

<p>“When do you track-layers expect to reach Salt
Lake?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“In 1870, anyway. It’s 650 miles yet. Congress
gives us till 1876 to meet the C. P., but General Dodge
and General Casement are going through in half that
time.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to tackle the Rocky Mountains,
though.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes,” said Terry. “But we’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“The Central Pacific of California have been building
only forty or fifty miles in a year, in their mountains.”</p>

<p>“We can beat the Central. They have timber and
supplies close where they’re working, and we haul
ours clear across the plains; but Casement’s Irish can
lick the Chinks any day,” scoffed Terry.</p>

<p>“Expect to beat the Central to Salt Lake, do you?”</p>

<p>“We’re going to meet them away beyond Salt Lake.
They’ll come east as fast as they can and we’ll go
west as fast as we can, and then we’ll both see.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and the Central Pacific say they’ll meet the
Union Pacific on the west side of the Rocky Mountains,
in Utah,” bantered Mr. Corwith.</p>

<p>“Well, they won’t. We’ll meet them before they’re
out of California,” boasted Terry. “General Casement
says he’ll put on 10,000 more men and be grading
several hundred miles ahead, all the time. The
mountains will give us ties. There are gangs cutting
timber in the Black Hills now, and getting it ready. A
railroad will be into Council Bluffs across from Omaha,
right away, so we’ll get our rails quick from the East.
We’ve got fifty locomotives, and 700 freight-cars, to
do the hauling with, and next year there’ll be a lot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
more. The bridges are made in Chicago and shipped
out all ready to be put up. Our men lay four rails
every minute—just as fast as they can grab and run
forward,” he added proudly. “And the spikers hit
each spike only three times.”</p>

<p>“We can see that you’re an enthusiastic U. P.
man,” laughed young Mr. Duff. “You ought to be
on the board of directors, along with my dad. But
the question now is, where are we going? Wonder
if we’ll meet any Indians.”</p>

<p>“General Dodge plans to take General Rawlins
through to Salt Lake, I understand,” spoke Mr. Corwith.
“The surveys have been made, and he wants
to check up. We cross the Black Hills by the pass
he discovered two years ago, when the Indians chased
him. He says it’s a remarkable route for a railroad—an
easy climb to over 8,000 feet; if the Indians
hadn’t forced him into it, he might never have known
about it. But he made a note of it, and sent the surveyors
out, and it’s all right.”</p>

<p>“How long before we reach it, then?”</p>

<p>“The Black Hills are 150 miles yet, I guess,”
said Terry.</p>

<p>“Ever there?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. The old stage road and the Salt Lake
trail went up around north of them. The stage road
now goes south of them. There’s never been any
road over the Black Hills, in here.”</p>

<p>“Well, hope we see some Indians, anyway,” chatted
Mr. Duff. “But all these soldiers probably’ll scare
’em off. I’d like to be out with one of those surveying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
parties. Those are the fellows who have the good
times.”</p>

<p>“George Stanton—he’s my partner—is out with
one. He’s out with Mr. Bates,” Terry announced.
“General Dodge said that maybe we’d find them.”</p>

<p>With the toiling wagons, they were several days in
passing the many gangs of graders. The low huts,
called “railroad forts,” of sod walls and sod or sheet-iron
roofs only about four feet above the ground, were
strewn for miles and miles in advance of the rails.</p>

<p>The old Overland stage road soon branched to the
north, for Fort Laramie, and guided by only the railroad
grade, the General Dodge expedition plodded on.
The ties ceased, the farthest outpost of the graders’
camps was at last left behind, and presently the final
squad of construction engineers engaged in running the
line of stakes and levels, had been dropped.</p>

<p>Now only the open country of the high rolling
plains lay before. The air was frosty, at night, but
warm by day. The curious antelope constantly stared,
with heads up, at the march, and skimmed away.
They supplied fine meat, when hunted by the soldiers
and civilians. General Rawlins appeared to be enjoying
himself immensely, but he was not strong.</p>

<p>During the day the cavalry rode before and in the
rear, and scouted on the flanks. The General Dodge
party cantered in the advance. At night camp was
pitched, in military order.</p>

<p>This seemed like home ground, to the general. He
had explored through it to find a railroad route away
back in 1855; and he had campaigned against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Sioux and Northern Cheyennes, hereabouts and beyond,
in 1865. That was the time when the Indians
had helped him to discover his pass.</p>

<p>A long line of dusky, frowning mountains was
gradually getting higher and plainer in the west.
These, said the general and Mr. Van Lennep, were the
southern end of the Black Hills—the first barrier by
the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>“I think that tomorrow we’ll strike Crow Creek,”
spoke the general, tonight, to the party around the blazing
camp fire. “That’s where we locate the next division
point, at the eastern base of the Black Hills. I
sent word to General Auger at Fort Laramie to meet
us there. He has instructions from General Grant to
locate a military post where the railroad locates its
division point.”</p>

<p>“Then we climb the mountains, do we, general?”
young Mr. Duff asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Up we go. But it’s a very easy trail,
by a long ridge. According to the engineers’ estimates
the grade is only ninety feet rise to the mile.
The country is smooth and open. As soon as the
Sioux forced my detachment to follow down by the
ridge, in ’65 when we were returning from the Powder
River campaign up north, I knew that we had found
the first passage of the Rocky Mountains. In fact,
I told my guide, then: ‘If we save our scalps, I believe
we’ve found a direct railroad pass from the
plains.’ And as soon as I reached Omaha, I described
the place to the engineers and my idea proved to be
correct. In the morning I’ll show you the little saddle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
on top, that we’ve named Sherman Summit, in honor
of General Sherman.”</p>

<p>“And what’s next, general?”</p>

<p>“The Laramie Plains, watered by the Laramie
River.”</p>

<p>“And then what?”</p>

<p>“A great basin, without any water at all. And the
Bitter Creek country beyond that, where the water
is worse than none at all.”</p>

<p>“But where do you cross the real Rockies—the big
snow mountains?”</p>

<p>“Oh, before we drop down into the Salt Lake
Valley. But we’re 6,000 feet up, right here on these
plains. Sherman Summit of the Black Hills, at over
8,000 feet, will be the highest point reached by the
railroad. There are several passes in the snowy range,
of between 7,000 and 8,000 feet, that we can use.
This Sherman Pass is the only one yet discovered by us
that will take us over the front range. The company
engineers spent two years in the field, exploring all
the way from Denver up to the old South Pass of
the Oregon Trail, looking for just this very thing;
and then it was found by accident—thanks to the
Indians.”</p>

<p>“Rather a joke on them, that when they tried to
keep you out they showed you through,” laughed
Major Dunn, the aide-de-camp.</p>

<p>“There’s something almost miraculous about it,”
added General Rawlins. “But the Central Pacific
hasn’t been as fortunate, I understand.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. They had a head start on us, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
Sierra Nevadas have fought them hard. While we’ve
been laying 370 miles of track across the plains, they’ve
been held to 120. They have an enormous amount of
blasting and tunneling and trestle building. In 100
miles they’re obliged to climb from sea level to over
7,000 feet. It’s a big job and they’re not out yet.
The snows there are heavier than in the Rockies.”</p>

<p>“Some people say the railroad across continent
can’t be operated in winter at all, on account of the
cold and snow in the mountains,” put in Mr. Corwith.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” muttered Mr. Van Lennep.</p>

<p>General Dodge laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, when the road is built, the operating will be
attended to. American engine men and train crews
who have fought Indians from cab and box car and
caboose, and hauled supplies in spite of savages and
weather and new roadbed will get the trains through,
snow or no snow.”</p>

<p>This was the first of July. The next morning they
rode on, and made noon camp on Crow Creek—named,
General Dodge explained, not for the bird
but for the Crow Indians. The camp was to be a
camp for several days, or until the general had picked
out the best location for the division point.</p>

<p>There was no sign of any railroad grade—except
in the distance before, and behind, tall stakes with
white rags tied to them: surveyors’ flags, planted this
spring or last fall. So the grade was only waiting
for pick and spade to awaken it.</p>

<p>“Those things extend clear to Nevady,” grunted
Sol Judy. “Injuns look on ’em as heap medicine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
They’re dead afraid to touch ’em. They’re leary of
the way the surveyors can squint through a telescope
set on three sticks, and set a flag further off’n it can
be seen by an Injun eye. They used to call the general
‘Long Eye,’ and when he began to lick ’em,
they got the notion he could shoot as far as he could
see with his spy-glass.”</p>

<p>General Dodge had taken General Rawlings, Colonel
Seymour, General Casement, Superintendent Reed and
the Government officials, with an escort of the cavalry,
to reconnoiter along the line. Mr. Van Lennep stayed
to write up some geological notes, and the rest loafed
around camp.</p>

<p>The Black Hills, bulky and dark and brooding,
loomed near in the west. They did not appear so very
high, because they were so big and rounded; pines
on them gave them their name “Black.” Down here
on the plains there were few trees; everything was
whity-brown.</p>

<p>Sol jerked his head to the northward and spoke
shortly.</p>

<p>“Here they come.”</p>

<p>“Who? The Indians?”</p>

<p>“Nope. Those aren’t Injuns; they’re troops—cavalry.
General Augur and his escort from Laramie,
I reckon.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think they’re soldiers, Sol?”
questioned young Mr. Duff. “Maybe they’re Sioux.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think; I know,” Sol retorted. “Don’t
you s’pose I can tell the difference ’tween a white man
and an Injun, far as I can see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>Sol’s eyes were the best in the camp; for when Mr.
Van Lennep leveled his field-glasses upon the little
bunch of moving figures wending down over the rolling
ridge of the north, he pronounced them soldiers,
sure enough.</p>

<p>They drew on. Presently the cavalry formed to
receive them, and Colonel Mizner galloped out to
meet them.</p>

<p>It was General C. C. Augur, all right, commanding
the Department of the Platte, and an escort of a troop
of the Second Cavalry, from the headquarters post,
old Fort Laramie.</p>

<p>“Yes, by gosh, and old Jim Bridger! Hooray!
Dod rot my cats!” And Sol, striding out, shook
hands heartily with the guide.</p>

<p>“Jim Bridger! That’s the man I’ve been wanting
to see,” exclaimed young Mr. Duff. “He and Kit
Carson are famous, aren’t they? They’re the greatest
scouts in the West.”</p>

<p>Sol Judy and Jim Bridger proceeded to squat and
hobnob, while Terry and Mr. Duff—and Mr. Corwith,
too—lingered near, curiously listening. General
Dodge’s party returned in haste. Tonight all
camped together. The general had about decided upon
a site for the division town; but old Jim principally
held the floor with his funny stories and quaint remarks.</p>

<p>He was a tall, wiry, leather-faced man; not so very
old in years but old in experience. Had trapped
beaver in the far West since 1823—had explored the
Salt Lake in a skin boat in 1826—claimed to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
been through the marvelous Yellowstone region years
before it was known to white men—had been owner
of the Bridger’s Fort trading post, in the mountains
on the Salt Lake and California Overland trail until
the Mormons of Utah had driven him out—had
guided the army through Indian country; and withal
was so full of funny stories that he could keep everybody
in a roar.</p>

<p>He and General Dodge were great friends.</p>

<p>“These gents thought I couldn’t tell you fellows
from Injuns, Jim,” complained Sol. “Yes, sir; and
didn’t believe me till they leveled the glasses on you.
Just as though I didn’t have eyes of my own.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, now; that’s not a wrinkle to what I’ve had
to put up with,” drawled old Jim. “When I was
guidin’ the troops on that thar Powder River campaign,
same time Gin’ral Dodge was out, I see an
Injun smoke only ’bout fifty miles yon, t’other side
a few mountains, an’ I reported to the cap’n. Says I:
‘Cap’n, thar’s an Injun camp yon, t’other side them
mountains, an’ they’re watchin’ ye, like as not.’
‘Whar, major?’ says he. ‘Right over thar by that
’er saddle,’ says I, p’intin’ for him. Wall, the cap’n
looked through his spy-glass, an’ said he couldn’t
see nary smoke. Then he reported to the gin’ral—Gin’ral
Conner, that was—an’ the gin’ral he looked
through his glass, an’ he couldn’t see. An’ thar was
the smoke colyumns as plain as the nose on your face,
only fifty mile away. So I didn’t say ’nother word,
’cept that it had come to a pretty state o’ things when
a passel o’ paper-collar soldiers’d tell a reg’lar mountain-man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
that thar wasn’t smoke when thar was.
But in two days some o’ Cap’n North’s Pawnees come
in from a scout yonder an’ blamed if they didn’t say
they’d located an Injun village precisely whar I’d seen
that thar smoke. So all we had to do was to go over
an’ get the Injuns, in the battle o’ Tongue River.”</p>

<p>“You must have wonderful eyesight, major,” complimented
Mr. Corwith. “I expect you are used to
seeing things.”</p>

<p>“Yep, arter forty years in the mountains a man
gets used to seein’ things. But even then he can’t
’most always sometimes tell. Did ye ever hear about
when I was in the Yallerstone? Wall, one time thar,
I think I see a passel o’ Injuns in camp ’bout three
mile off, an’ I reckoned they saw me; but I watched
’em a long time, kinder curyus, an’ they didn’t get any
closer; an’ when I was sneakin’ ’round, durned if I
didn’t run slap ag’in the side of a mountain, solid
crystal, cl’ar as air, an’ three miles through. You
see, them Injuns war on t’other side of it; an’ they
couldn’t get at me an’ I couldn’t get at them.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t the same mountain the Indians chased
you around, was it, major?” slyly asked General
Dodge.</p>

<p>“No, sir. But that thar was a great trick, wasn’t
it? You see, gents, some Injuns got arter me, on the
side of a mountain. So I jest run an’ run, afoot,
’round an’ ’round, like a squirrel on a stump, an’ they
tuk arter. We all run an’ we run; and what with
bein’ on a slant, like, pretty soon the down-hill legs
o’ the Injuns’ ponies got stretched, tryin’ to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
their footin’; an’ when I seed, I made for level ground.
Then the ponies couldn’t do nothin’ but run circles,
their legs bein’ unequal; an’ I got away, easy.”</p>

<p>The next morning the site of the new division
point was staked by Mr. Evans and surveyors, under
direction of General Dodge. There did not seem
to be much choice—the bare rolling plains looked all
much the same, clear to the foot of the Laramie Range
which was called the Black Hills; but he had figured
closely. Crow Creek would supply water; Denver was
about 115 miles south, Julesburg was 140 miles east—a
branch line would be run down to Denver, and
the trains from the east would change engines here,
for the climb over the Black Hills. It would be a
place for a junction, and for a round-house.</p>

<p>“I name it Cheyenne,” said the general, “for Cheyenne
Pass, which you see to the north.”</p>

<p>“The military post will be just north, gentlemen,”
quoth General Augur. “The War Department approving,
it will be named Fort D. A. Russell, in honor
of Major-General David Allen Russell, a gallant soldier
who won honors in the Mexican War and was
killed in battle September 19, 1864, where his conduct
gained him the brevet of major-general.”</p>

<p>“Wall, this hyar business o’ locatin’ towns whar
thar ain’t people seems to be rather pecoolar,” drawled
Jim Bridger. “A feller hyar with last month’s pay
in his pocket couldn’t spend a cent. Anyhow, thar’s
plenty elbow room. That’s the best thing about it.”</p>

<p>“Wait till the news gets to Denver, and Julesburg.
In six months you won’t be able to turn around,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
where you’re now standing,” smiled Mr. Van Lennep.</p>

<p>“Listen!” General Dodge sharply ordered.</p>

<p>Distant in the south there welled the faint reports
of volleying fire-arms.</p>

<p>“Injun scrimmage, shore,” pronounced old Jim.
“Fust an’ original inhabitants are on hand.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like an attack on a wagon train,” rapped
the general. “Mount, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Here come the cavalry. Hurrah!” cheered young
Mr. Duff.</p>

<p>The soldier escort were straightening in their saddles,
awaiting command; but from the camp a bugle
had pealed, and Troops B and M, led by Lieutenant
Wheelan and Surgeon Terry, were tearing in columns
of fours across the plain, following the battle signals.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>GENERAL DODGE SHOWS THE WAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Come</span> on. Let’s see the fun!” excitedly cried
young Mr. Duff, to Terry. “Maybe we can take a
hand.”</p>

<p>“Yes—an’ mebbe you’ll lose yore hair,” Jim
Bridger reproved.</p>

<p>“What do you say, General Rawlins? Shall we go
over?” General Dodge queried—in tone about as
eager as Mr. Duff’s. “We can show you Indian
fighting——”</p>

<p>“General Augur commands, here, I believe. We’re
in his department. If he thinks best——”</p>

<p>General Augur immediately barked a gruff command.
The lieutenant in charge of the escort company
shouted gladly. The company were already at
attention, ready.</p>

<p>“By fours, march! Column right, march!
Comp’ny, trot!” And—— “Gallop!”</p>

<p>Away they dashed: The cavalry, old Jim Bridger
(who rode like an Indian, his long hair streaming from
under his greasy slouch hat), General Dodge, General
Rawlins, General Augur, General Myers, Colonel
Mizner, Major Dunn, young Mr. Duff, Mr. Corwith,
Mr. Van Lennep the geologist, Sol, Terry, and all.</p>

<p>“The yaller legs are thar,” called Jim. For the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
bugle had shrilled again, from the two companies now
out of sight; and the heavy reports of the cavalry
carbines joined with the other battle sounds.</p>

<p>“Right front into line!” The cavalry escort
spread into company front; but as they charged into
sight of the field, the gun-shots had become fitful and
scattered. From the last little rise they saw what had
occurred.</p>

<p>Down in the flat, before, a number of hooded wagons
had partially corralled, or formed a circle—the horses
still hitched. Beyond, a portion of the cavalry were
pursuing some fleeing Indians; and the rest of the
cavalry were rounding up and catching a quantity of
loose horses and cattle.</p>

<p>Doctor Terry was busy, passing among the wagons,
occasionally stopping here and there.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! We’re too late,” panted Mr. Duff, as
everybody slackened pace. “What is it—emigrant
train?”</p>

<p>“No. A grading outfit coming in to the road,”
answered General Dodge. “Who were the Indians,
major? Cheyennes, I judge.”</p>

<p>“Sioux, too, I reckon,” replied Jim Bridger. “A
passel o’ Dog Soldiers, like as not.”</p>

<p>“Cavalry made ’em run. They can’t stand the
cavalry,” exulted Mr. Corwith.</p>

<p>“Aw, sho’, now!” grunted Jim. “Pony soldiers
don’t worry ’em none. It’s the walk-a-heap soldiers
that set ’em to thinkin’. They know the walk-a-heaps
have got to fight or be killed—can’t run off.”</p>

<p>“They certainly made a bold attempt, to attack like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
this within a mile of a military camp,” General
Rawlins remarked.</p>

<p>“That’s their style of fighting, general,” replied
General Augur. “When you don’t see them and don’t
expect them, there they are.”</p>

<p>It was a Mormon wagon train to help the road
along. The Indians had ambushed them from a
ravine—had killed two men, wounded others,
stampeded the loose stock, and likely would have
“wiped out” the whole party, Jim Bridger asserted,
had the troops not arrived in nick of time.</p>

<p>“That’s a sample of what’s been happening to train
crews, track-layers, graders, and survey parties from
Fort Kearney in Nebraska clear to the mountains,
general,” remarked General Dodge to General Rawlins.
“The people out East cannot appreciate. We’re
simply having to fight our way through, and every
mile is stained with blood. It was only six miles east
of Cheyenne that poor Hills, one of my best chief
assistant engineers, was killed.”</p>

<p>Their wounded having been attended to by Dr.
Terry, the Mormon graders sent a delegation to the
division site, where the two dead were to be buried.</p>

<p>“We start that thar town with a graveyard,” Jim
Bridger grimly announced. “An’ they ain’t the last
who’ll be buried thar with their boots on.”</p>

<p>The sturdy Mormon graders were given a small
escort of the cavalry, to guard them on their farther
journey. They reported that the Indians were very
bad, along the trail west.</p>

<p>“We’ll camp here another day, and spend the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Fourth,” General Dodge said, this night. “I think
it will be only fitting for General Rawlins, who represents
the commander of the United States Army,
to make the Independence address, as Orator of the
Day.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it with pleasure, sir,” agreed General
Rawlins.</p>

<p>Two other surveying parties, under Assistant
Engineers Maxwell and O’Neill, joined the camp.
The next day General Rawlins delivered a splendid
patriotic speech, to the paraded cavalry, the wagon
train and the railroad men—here, July 4, 1867, on
the site of the future city of Cheyenne, Wyoming.</p>

<p>After that there was a split-up. Mr. Maxwell and
Mr. O’Neill and their surveyors were set at work completing
the survey lines from the east into Cheyenne,
so as to have it ready for the graders from Julesburg.
When they had done this, they were to finish
the surveying of the town lots of new Cheyenne.</p>

<p>General Augur and his escort rode for Fort
Laramie, northward. General Myers went back to
end o’ track, for Fort McPherson near North Platte,
in order to attend to his quartermaster’s department.</p>

<p>Geologist Van Lennep prepared to scout southward,
and locate coal-fields. Coal-fields and building stone
and minerals were important on a railroad route.</p>

<p>Taking General Casement, the chief “builder,” and
General Rawlins, the guest of honor, and Division
Engineer Evans, and the government officials, and the
rest, including, of course, Terry, General Dodge proceeded
west.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“By the time we return through here, there’ll be a
town in full blast,” promised the general.</p>

<p>“We’re empire builders, not railroad builders,”
laughed Mr. Corwith. “As we travel on, we leave
towns where we tread.”</p>

<p>“I feel like a Columbus, myself,” young Mr. Duff
declared. “Opening a new world.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know what Senator Benton said, twenty
years ago. He proposed that where the first railroad
crossed the Rocky Mountains the Government ought
to carve a big figure of Christopher Columbus out of
a peak, overlooking the rails east and west.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and when somebody called such a line a
modern Colossus of Rhodes, another senator twisted
it into Colossus of Rail-Roads!”</p>

<p>“When do we strike the pass, general?”</p>

<p>“We’ll be into it when we camp tonight. But I’ll
wager that none of you will know the difference.”</p>

<p>“What, sir?”</p>

<p>“There is Evans Pass, gentlemen, in plain sight.
First named Lone Tree Pass, then Sherman Pass, and
finally changed to Evans Pass in honor of Mr. Evans
himself, who was the chief engineer in the field party
that surveyed it after I had described the landmarks
to him. He found it by a lone tree at the foot. You
may have noticed a lone pine, a short distance back.
That was our landmark.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you call it a pass, general,” ventured
Mr. Corwith.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a pass because it gets the railroad over
the high country. Nature seems to have made it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
especially for a trans-continental railroad. We are
following the backbone of a long ridge which extends
from the plains to the top of the Black Hills. These
Black Hills don’t look to be so very difficult, but their
flanks are so broken by ravines and steep slopes, that
the grades and fills are impossible. This ridge is a
natural divide with scarcely a break, and carries the
road like an inclined trestle. We rise 2,000 feet in
thirty-two miles; that gives us, according to Mr. Evans’
surveys, a maximum grade of ninety feet to a mile,
and the Government allows us 116 feet to a mile, at a
pinch.”</p>

<p>“You consider this the beginning of the base of the
Rocky Mountains, do you, general?” queried Mr.
Blickensderfer.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. In fact, the base begins at Cheyenne,
as you and Mr. Carter may determine from the table
of altitudes prepared by the engineers. The rise is deceptive.
It’s the only bit of good luck we’ve struck.
Our engineers looked for two years, to find it.”</p>

<p>“The Government allows you $48,000 a mile, in
building over the mountains, doesn’t it?” asked General
Rawlins. “And you can build here almost as
fast as on the plains.”</p>

<p>“Faster. But the allowance is $48,000 a mile for
only the first 150 miles from the base of the mountains.
After that we get $32,000 a mile for the distance to the
base of the California mountains. On the plains, to
this point, we’ve been allowed $16,000 a mile, and that
nearly beat us. We’ve had to haul our ties and iron
and timbers and supplies at ruinous expense. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
here we’re close in touch with the timbered
mountains and we may be enabled to float our ties
down the streams to points near the grades; this red
decomposed granite under foot makes perfect ballast;
many of the cuts will be in soft soil; and we’ll have
good coal for the engines. Cheap fuel is an important
item in railroading. The next engines to be sent out
from the East will be coal-burners instead of wood-burners.”</p>

<p>Assuredly, Terry thought, there were a number of
items to be planned for, when building a railroad
line.</p>

<p>“So,” continued the general, “at $48,000 a mile, in
such a country, we may be able to save a little money
for the work ahead, where we’ll get only $32,000 a
mile, mountains or no mountains. The Central Pacific
had easier going, at the start. They began almost
at once with $48,000 a mile, in the California foothills;
but as they climb, they’ve found so much blasting
and tunneling and bridging necessary, that their
mountain money looks about as small to them as our
plains money to us. It will be nip and tuck between
us.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get there first, just the same,” Terry blurted.
He could not help it.</p>

<p>“Where, young man?”</p>

<p>“To Salt Lake, and a lot farther, too, sir!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the track-layer gang!” cheered young
Mr. Duff; and they all laughed.</p>

<p>The climb could be felt, if not seen. The saddle-animals
puffed, the four-horse and six-horse wagon-train<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
teams tugged at the heavy wagons. The trail,
marked by the few survey stakes and flags set last year
by Engineer Evans, stretched on, across little ridges
and flats and ravines, each higher than the preceding
one. Crow Creek seemed to have sunk into a broad
valley, below and behind, and the site of Cheyenne,
with its two graves, had merged into an unfolding flatness.
Mr. Blickensderfer, who had been sent by the
President to decide upon the real base of the Rocky
Mountains, could not but admit that the base was
back where the engineers’ map located it.</p>

<p>The country before and beyond unfolded, too, little
by little, and spread out in vastness. A mountain
chain—mountains with snow patches on them—uplifted
far and farther, high and higher. The breeze
began to waft chill. The outcrops of rocks were
many and curious, like witches and giants and towers.</p>

<p>The next afternoon the general suddenly halted the
advance, scanned right and left intently, and with a
word to Engineer Evans removed his slouch hat.</p>

<p>“Sherman Summit, gentlemen. This is the top,
at 8,250 feet. Sherman Station and a water tank
will be on this very spot.”</p>

<p>“Over already, general?”</p>

<p>“Down grade from here on.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you have run the road around the north
end of this divide?” asked Mr. Blickensderfer.</p>

<p>“Yes, we could. The engineers surveyed for a line
there, to strike the old Oregon Trail and the famous
South Pass which had been used for many years by
the emigrants. But we would lose a number of miles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
and we’d miss the coal-fields. We also wished to build
around the south, through Denver, but the mountains
of Colorado seem to offer no easy passes.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t the Continental Divide, is it, general?
Not the divide between the Atlantic and Pacific?”</p>

<p>“No. It’s a spur of the front range of the Rockies.
Yonder in the west you can see the Continental Divide—a
portion of it: the Medicine Bow Range of the
main Rockies. From here the road descends into the
Laramie Plains, and follows a wide trough or basin
for perhaps 100 miles northwest, to round the Medicine
Bow. After that, from the North Platte River the
route is undetermined, but is being surveyed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and once across the Laramie Plains you’ll
carry yore water with you,” said Sol Judy, gazing
ahead as, dismounted, he leaned on his long musket.
“By Jinks, beyond the Plains there’s a stretch of desert
country that even a bird can’t cross without packing
its own supplies.”</p>

<p>“Which is one thing that we’ve come to look into,”
General Dodge replied. “Percy Browne and his
party are running a line, over in there, now. He has
the division from the North Platte River west to
Green River, 180 miles. The Tom Bates party are
off in there, too,” the general added kindly, to Terry.
“They’re working east from the Wasatch Mountains
of Utah, while Browne works west from the North
Platte edge of the Laramie Plains. So we’ll keep an
eye out for your boy friend.”</p>

<p>“About like looking for a needle in a haystack,”
remarked young Duff, aside, to Terry. “That all is
the biggest country I ever saw.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>And big it was, as they marched down from Sherman
Summit: range after range of towering mountains
to south, west, and north with glimpses of immense
valleys between, and the slumberous basin of the
Laramie Plains below.</p>

<p>Engineer Evans’ survey stakes led on. He had run
the line clear to the Laramie River at Fort Sanders.
Superintendent Reed was an engineer, also, and had
surveyed through the Wasatch Mountains and down
to Salt Lake, in 1864. The talk about the country
ahead was mighty interesting to Terry, and Mr. Corwith,
and young Mr. Duff.</p>

<p>Sol Judy and others spoke well of the Laramie
Plains.</p>

<p>“The finest hunting-country in the world, down
there,” asserted Sol. “Plenty running water, buffalo,
antelope, beaver, and Injuns. But t’other side—I tell
you, a jack-rabbit won’t go in without a canteen, and
a crow sheds tears when he bids his family good-by.”</p>

<p>They camped this night on the west slope of Sherman
Summit, amidst more strange rock figures, of
chimneys and spires and castle turrets. Then they
wound on down, to refit at Fort Sanders near present
Laramie City of Wyoming—— “The terminal point
of the 288 miles of track that we expect to lay this
year, although people say that we can’t do it,” explained
General Dodge.</p>

<p>At Fort Sanders they received bad news.</p>

<p>Young Mr. Duff brought the word out to the camp,
while the general and others were at the post headquarters
talking with Colonel Gibbon, the commander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Well, the Indians have added some more graves
to the survey stakes, boys,” he said.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Van Lennep told me—and I heard it at headquarters,
too. Van Lennep’s been here several days,
waiting for us. It’s the Percy Browne party, this
time. The Sioux struck them north of here, short
time ago; killed a cavalry sergeant—fine fellow—and
a civilian named Stephen Clark, from Albany,
New York—another fine fellow. He was a nephew
of Thurlow Weed, the big New York State politician
and editor. The Indians almost captured the whole
camp; ran off some mules and seized a lot of supplies.
Mr. Browne brought Clark’s body in here, to
the fort, for burial. Then he went out again. No
Indians can stop those surveyors.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything about the Mr. Bates
party?” Terry asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, I guess they’re away out, beyond reach. The
soldiers say the Sioux are on a rampage, this year.
Hope nobody else is killed. We’re going to travel
along, just the same. The general means to find the
Browne and the Bates gangs, and see about matters.
We’ve got men enough to lick the reds.”</p>

<p>Fort Sanders was a small, lonely post, beside the
Laramie River in the south end of the Laramie Plains,
twenty-five miles from Sherman Summit. Colonel,
or General, John Gibbon of the Thirty-sixth Infantry
commanded. There was one troop, G, of the Second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
Cavalry, under First Lieutenant John A. Wanless.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wanless and other officers paid a visit
to the cavalry camp of the expedition; and when, after
two or three days of resting and out-fitting, the expedition
pulled out again, Lieutenant Wanless rode a half
mile with his brother cavalrymen.</p>

<p>“Good-by and good luck,” he bade. “You clean
the trail in the one direction and we’ll be watching for
the engine smoke in the other.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>MORE BAD NEWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the easy Rattlesnake Pass that finally led out
from the farther edge of the great Laramie Plains,
and down to the North Platte River.</p>

<p>“There’s the last of the main streams which flow
eastward, men,” remarked General Dodge, as from
the top of the pass they emerged into view of the
valley below. “Once across that, and over the next
plateau, and we’ll be into the unknown country.”</p>

<p>“Can we see the Overland stage road, general?”</p>

<p>“It keeps to the base of those south hills, on the
headwaters of the side streams, for fording.”</p>

<p>“I should think that the railroad would follow the
stage road, by the trail already made,” spoke Mr.
Corwith.</p>

<p>The general smiled.</p>

<p>“No. The grades are too sharp and there are
too many ravines and gulches, too many streams, too
many detours. A railroad always seeks the path of
least resistance; and we’re limited by the Government
to the grade of 116 feet to the mile, at the maximum.
The Union Pacific will keep to the open country, and
do away with curves as much as possible. Sharp
tangents cut down speed. Lack of water doesn’t
bother a railroad, if wells for tanks can be drilled, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
intervals. In fact, the fewer streams to cross, the
better.”</p>

<p>A month had gone by since from Sherman Summit
they had descended a thousand feet into the Laramie
Plains. It had been a continuous hunting and camping
trip with the Indians at safe distance. The
general had traveled by easy stints, to favor the health
of General Rawlins, and let Geologist Van Lennep
make his investigation for coal and ballast. A courier
from Sanders had brought a dispatch saying that Mr.
Evans’ wife was ill, in the East, and he had turned
back.</p>

<p>The Laramie Plains had proved to be a great basin
or park, watered by trout streams, tinted with red soil
and rocks, and green brush and trees, broken by strange
buttes and spires, and surrounded by snow-capped
mountains. It stretched fifty miles wide, and 100
miles long, in northwesterly direction. The railroad
line was to follow it and take advantage of such an
open way.</p>

<p>Several times they had signs of other parties—the
Browne surveying crews, General Dodge pronounced
them. Now and again an abandoned surveyor’s flag
fluttered from bush or pole.</p>

<p>“Who’d ’a thought when Jim Bridger and I trapped
our beaver and fought for our meat in here, that the
iron hoss’d be rampaging through before ever we lost
our scalps,” Sol Judy mused. “That is, if we don’t
lose those same scalps in the meantime.”</p>

<p>They followed down a stream which emptied into
the Platte, and camped this night on the banks of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
the North Platte itself, which flowing north from
Colorado turned for the east and joined the South
Platte 300 miles away, at North Platte Station on the
railroad, in Nebraska.</p>

<p>“And next year at this time the railroad will be
here, I guess,” Terry ventured. “Wonder if the river
knows.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem possible,” Mr. Corwith mused.</p>

<p>“And in another year the rails will be climbing
those mountains that look like cloud banks,” added
young Mr. Duff.</p>

<p>“Your eye-sight’s improving, young man,” Sol
joked. “You’re spying the main Rockies; and if
’twarn’t for those clouds I reckon you could look another
hundred and fifty miles, into Utah.”</p>

<p>Sol had been scouting around, and had found traces
of a deserted camp down stream a short distance.
The general was quite certain that this had been a
camp of the Percy Browne surveyors and escort.</p>

<p>“Camp’s about three weeks old, I judge,” Sol reported.</p>

<p>“Hoo-ee-ee!” sounded the high call, through the
dusk.</p>

<p>“White man, that,” Sol uttered. “Yep, and there
they are.”</p>

<p>Across the Platte there were two or three horsemen,
who had united in the “Hoo-ee-ee.” Now here
they came, fording and swimming. General Dodge
beckoned them in, and met them as they rode forward,
dripping.</p>

<p>He and Colonel Seymour, the consulting engineer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
held a short confab with them. They all turned for
the camp.</p>

<p>“That’s Frank Appleton, Percy Browne’s assistant,”
Superintendent Reed exclaimed. “Wonder if anything’s
gone wrong again.”</p>

<p>“Well, men don’t swim cold rivers for nothing,”
drawled Sol, who was standing and warming the tails
of his army overcoat.</p>

<p>The General Dodge squad arrived at the big camp
fire. The general’s face was grave; so was Colonel
Seymour’s. Everybody at the fire waited intent—General
Rawlins, lying under a blanket to rest, half sat
up.</p>

<p>The new-comers were two surveyors and a cavalry
trooper. They and their horses appeared worn to the
bones. The two surveyors dismounted stiffly, to advance
to the fire, with a haggard smile and a brave
“Good evening.” The trooper led the horses aside,
for unsaddling and picketing out.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, permit me to introduce Mr. Francis
Appleton, and Mr. Bane, of the Percy Browne party,”
spoke the general. “Mr. Appleton was the assistant
engineer; now he is in charge of the party. He brings
word of the loss of his chief. Percy Browne, a young
engineer already at the top of his profession and one of
my right-hand men, has been killed by the Sioux.”</p>

<p>“What! Another—and this time Browne!”
gasped Mr. Blickensderfer.</p>

<p>“I sorter felt it,” remarked Sol.</p>

<p>“Where did that happen, and how?” queried General
Rawlins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“Can you tell them about it, Frank?” suggested
General Dodge.</p>

<p>Engineer Appleton—he was young, too—sat down
and stretched his legs and hands to the blaze.</p>

<p>“It happened about two weeks ago. We were running
a line on the main divide, near Separation, about
fifty miles west of here, or at survey station 6,801,
when Mr. Browne left us, to reconnoiter in the basin
country farther west. He’d found the maps of the
region were wrong—they did not cover all that territory,
especially a new basin that we call the Red Desert.
The Salt Lake stage road skirts the edge of it, on the
way to the Bitter Creek desert.</p>

<p>“Mr. Browne took eight of the cavalry escort and
some pack animals. We were to work on a line at the
east edge. It seems that he had almost crossed the
Red Desert, when a band of 300 Sioux, who were
making south to attack the stage stations, surrounded
him and his escort. The men succeeded in fighting
their way to a little hill, and there they forted, and
held the Sioux off from noon until after dark. Just
at dusk a ball had struck Mr. Browne in the stomach,
and put him out of action. He knew he was done for,
so he ordered the soldiers to leave him and break for
safety; but they wouldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“What! Soldiers leave their officer? Never!”
rapped Colonel Mizner. “Not the Second Cavalry
men—nor any other men, either.”</p>

<p>“And they didn’t,” asserted Mr. Appleton. “They
refused to obey Browne’s orders. They let the Sioux
stampede the horses and mules, which seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
satisfy the red-skins, who drew off. So this same
night those eight soldiers made a litter of a blanket
slung on carbines, and afoot they carried poor Percy
fifteen miles through the sage-brush and the sand to
LaClede stage station on the Overland. They didn’t
save his life, though, for he died soon after they got
in with him.”</p>

<p>“A gallant deed,” said General Rawlins. “I’ll see
to it that it’s brought personally before General Grant
himself. We must have those soldiers’ names.”</p>

<p>“The news was telegraphed from the stage station
to Sanders,” continued Mr. Appleton, “but of course
General Dodge had passed through, before that. The
soldiers found us, where we were waiting for Mr.
Browne to return. I went ahead running a line according
to the instructions, until my party became pretty
well exhausted through lack of water and provisions.
I was coming in to Fort Sanders, for more supplies
and for further instructions, and sighted your fires,
here. I guess that’s about all. The rest of the party
are about forty miles west. They’re short of water,
and animals, and unable to move forward—but they
hate to quit. With a little help we’ll push right along,
as Mr. Browne had intended, and finish out the survey
according to his plans.”</p>

<p>“By Jiminy! That’s the stuff!” applauded young
Mr. Duff.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. The survey shall be carried out. We’ll
enter the Browne basin,” declared the general. “We’ll
give Mr. Appleton and Mr. Bane a day’s rest here,
while I check over with them. Unfortunately all of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Mr. Browne’s notes were lost when the Indians attacked
him. But we’ll march on, to the Appleton
party ahead, fix them up, and proceed to find the
Bates party, too. Nothing has been seen of them,
Mr. Appleton says.”</p>

<p>The North Platte flowed through a wide and shallow
valley of sage-brush and reddish gravel, blotched by
bright green cottonwoods and willows, with a scattering
of small pines and cedars on the slopes. The
river had to be forded; but the wagons were tugged
through, and they all toiled up the west slope to the
top of a broad plateau.</p>

<p>“The beginning of the Bitter Creek plains,” General
Dodge uttered. “Any streams in here, Frank?”</p>

<p>“We discovered none, sir,” Mr. Appleton answered.
“That is, none now flowing. There are numerous dry
courses.”</p>

<p>The high plateau stretched onward into the west.
It was of reddish gravel, plentifully cloaked with sage,
like the rolling swells of a mighty grayish sea, and now
and again blotched with the white of alkali, like the
patchy froth of a sea. Sharp buttes, like islands, rose
in the distances around, breaking the surface. Altogether,
it was a lonely sight.</p>

<p>“How far are your party, Frank?”</p>

<p>“We’ll reach them tomorrow, sir. There’s a plain
trail—my own trail, and the lines we ran.”</p>

<p>The party were all right, and waiting patiently for
water and horses. The general decided to send them
back to the North Platte, to rest and refit from Fort
Sanders; but he took Mr. Appleton, as a guide to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
great basin which Mr. Percy Browne had entered.</p>

<p>He and General Rawlins and Mr. Appleton led, with
Terry and Sol Judy close behind; the rest of the party
followed; the wagon train labored in the rear, while
the cavalry bobbed up and down on either flank, riding
dusty and sunburned, but watchful for Indians.</p>

<p>Indeed, dusty and sunburned were all: the once
smooth faces of Major Dunn and Mr. Duff had
sprouted beards, Terry’s face was parched and roughened,
and everybody had the appearance of old campaigners.</p>

<p>It was hard on General Rawlins. The water in
the casks had been divided with the survey party; that
in the canteens was warm; and General Dodge had
ordered that the casks and the canteens be tapped just
as seldom as possible.</p>

<p>“I’d give my commission for a drink of good
water,” suddenly spoke General Rawlins. “But I
don’t suppose there is such a thing.”</p>

<p>“You shall have it, general,” answered General
Dodge. “If you’re able, we’ll ride ahead of the main
party and see what we can find. Mr. Appleton and
Sol can bring them on.” He turned in his saddle and
swept the group with keen eye. “Who’s with us?
You’ll want your aide, of course. All right, Major
Dunn. Then I’ll take my own aide. Come along,
Terry. Gentlemen, we’ll have fresh water waiting for
you, when you catch us.”</p>

<p>Weaving among the outcrops of red and gray rock,
and the clumps of silent sage, while the gravel crunched
under hoof and the sun beat hotly above, they four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
rode for an hour, leaving the cavalry and wagon train
farther and farther behind. Every draw was dry.
General Rawlins began to droop in his seat. He was
not strong—had consumption; but he was plucky,
for he was a soldier.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll do better to spread out,” General
Dodge finally directed. “Four abreast. But each of
us must halt on the top of every ridge and swell, until
the others are in sight. We can’t exercise too much
care, in this kind of a country.”</p>

<p>They rode for still an hour, into the west. The
Browne survey had been through here—Terry himself
saw the trails, here and there, and the flags and
stakes; but pretty soon he lost them. His course,
on the right of the searching line, took him where
the only traces of life were the jack-rabbits.</p>

<p>Then, dipping down into another of the gravelly
draws, he noticed a narrow trail swinging through the
middle of it. His tired horse pricked its ears, and
quickened its pace. A coyote trail, this—yes, marked
by antelope hoofs, too; evidently going somewhere.
An antelope trail usually led to water, if followed far
enough. If the water happened to be near—then,
hurrah! It would be great luck for a boy to find
water when General Dodge, the explorer, and General
Rawlins, chief-of-staff of the United States Army, both
were looking for it. So Terry hopefully pressed forward,
in the narrow antelope trail.</p>

<p>The draw turned a rocky shoulder; a couple of
coyotes lifted their sharp noses, and were away like
tawny shadows; Terry’s horse eagerly nickered; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
here, near before, there was a spot of green in the
desert dun.</p>

<p>A spring, sure enough!</p>

<p>Terry hauled his horse about—“General Rawlins
first, old fellow. But you’ll get some”—and forced
him up the side of the draw, to spread the good word.</p>

<p>One after another the men saw him, and in they
came, answering his signals. General Dodge was
nearest.</p>

<p>“What is it? Water?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. We found a spring.”</p>

<p>“Good! Where?”</p>

<p>“Straight down in this draw, sir.”</p>

<p>“Sweet water? Did you taste it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I didn’t taste it, but it looks sweet. The
coyotes and antelope have been drinking it.”</p>

<p>“Rawlins!” shouted the general. “Come along.
Here’s water.”</p>

<p>General Rawlins came. So did Major Dunn. Following
Terry, in they went.</p>

<p>“General Rawlins is entitled to the first drink, I
believe,” said General Dodge, huskily, as they reined
their horses around the little spring.</p>

<p>“You fellows are as thirsty as I am. Who found
it? This boy? Then the finder is entitled to the first
drink.”</p>

<p>“He’s declined. Drink, man, or it’s liable to disappear.”</p>

<p>They gravely watched General Rawlins throw himself
down and quaff.</p>

<p>“Whew!” he gasped, pausing. “It’s a miracle—cold
and sweet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>They all drank—General Dodge, Major Dunn, and
Terry last; they let the horses drink.</p>

<p>“I told you that a boy would be handy to have in
camp and on the march, general,” slyly reminded General
Dodge.</p>

<p>“I feel as though he had saved my life,” and General
Rawlins smiled. “This water is the most
gracious thing of the whole march, to date. There’s
nothing that takes the place of sweet water, when a
man is thirsty. If my name is ever placed upon a map,
I hope that it will be applied to a spring.”</p>

<p>“Your wish is granted at once, general,” laughed
General Dodge. “Here is the spot, and I name it
Rawlins Springs. The line of the railroad will run
very close to it, I think—we’re about the right distance
for a townsite. Within a year there’ll be a
Rawlins Springs town here.”</p>

<p>“Well, if the town’s anything like Julesburg, they’ll
be drinking other fluids than water, I’m afraid,” General
Rawlins smiled.</p>

<p>The cavalry and wagon train were signaled in, and
camp was made at Rawlins Springs, near where today
is situated the city of Rawlins, Wyoming, on the
first of the railroads across continent.</p>

<p>“Now, if you’re only lucky enough to find the
Bates party, and your friend George Stanton——!”
young Mr. Duff proposed, this evening, to Terry.</p>

<p>That was so. Sol Judy and Mr. Appleton declared
that the country on ahead was much worse. George
was somewhere in it—and Terry began to worry a
little.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>A MEETING IN THE DESERT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> roof of the continent, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>It was the second day after leaving Rawlins Springs.
Mr. Blickensderfer, the government representative;
Mr. Carter, the director; Colonel Seymour, the railroad
expert, General Casement and Superintendent
Reed had turned back yesterday, for the Black Hills
again. They had taken an escort and a couple of
wagons. So now the party were formed of only General
Dodge, General Rawlins, Geologist Van Lennep,
Mr. Corwith, young Mr. Duff, Engineer Appleton, Sol
Judy and Terry, accompanied by Colonel Mizner,
Lieutenant Wheelan, Surgeon Terry and the cavalry
and teamsters.</p>

<p>From Rawlins Springs on across the high plateau
there had been a gradual steady climb, according to the
general; until here, this late afternoon, he made the
startling announcement:</p>

<p>“The roof of the continent, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“You mean this is the ridge dividing the waters
that flow east from the waters that flow west?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. The Continental Divide, formed by the
Rocky Mountains.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t look it,” complained young Mr.
Duff. “It’s too flat. I expected to see more of a
ridge. This is nothing but a long hump. Are we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
higher than Sherman Summit of the Black Hills?”</p>

<p>“No. Sherman Summit, at 8,250 feet, is the highest
point on the proposed line. The main divide, here,
is scarcely more than 7,000. That is one beauty of
the survey as run by Mr. Browne before his death.
We cross the Continental Divide at its lowest point,
by an easy grade. South in Colorado we would have
to cross at 12,000 feet; and north we would have to
cross at 9,000 feet.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of ridge-poles, young man,” Sol put in,
“you cast yore eye ’round and you’ll see where the
ridge-poles were used. But once in a while the builders
of this roof had to make a spot to sit down on.”</p>

<p>And truly, the view from this immense “hump”
was superb. Far in north and south and west uplifted
the jagged snowy ranges—the real mountains
of Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, with this great bare
plateau stretching between like a broad trough. Behind,
or east, they could look back upon the Laramie
Plains, shimmering below.</p>

<p>“Mr. Appleton says that tomorrow morning we’ll
sight the Percy Browne basin of the Red Desert,” Mr.
Corwith remarked, after supper, in camp.</p>

<p>“How far ahead?”</p>

<p>“As soon as we cross this divide. Then we drop
right into it.”</p>

<p>General Dodge had been correct. Within a few
miles from camp, in the morning, they were going
down hill. The Laramie Plains were cut off, so was
much of the plateau itself, but the mountains before,
and hazy in the distance, rose more and more, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
flat desert gradually creeping out from their base.
After all, the “hump” was a rounded ridge—a sort
of welt.</p>

<p>It fell away, with a long slant—and suddenly the
party halted short, craning forward, almost speechless,
to the pointing arm of General Dodge.</p>

<p>“The unknown land,” he uttered. “The Browne
basin, and the Red Desert.”</p>

<p>“Where poor Percy gave up his life,” added Engineer
Appleton.</p>

<p>“Yes, and where many another good man has ended
his trail,” added Sol Judy.</p>

<p>From the foot of the slant, onward below there
extended, now fully revealed, so vast a basin that it
might have been the floor of a dry ocean. They were
gazing down into it, as if from the side of an amphitheater.
Lofty mountains, some of them a hundred
miles away, surrounded it with a fringe of cloudlike
crests. The clear air rested upon it and gave it a
setting of crystal.</p>

<p>There were abrupt little cone-like peaks, patches of
white, patches of red, patches of dark brush; and over
all a wondrous blue sky without a break, through which
the hot sun rode high.</p>

<p>The basin looked enchanted and mysterious.</p>

<p>“The unknown land,” repeated General Dodge,
thoughtfully. “The Overland Stage road crosses, for
the Bitter Creek country, beyond. But there are no
other trails. There may be no streams, either. Those
white patches are soda and alkali, of course. The red
is granite and sandstone—good ballast stuff for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
roadbed. Lacking any streams flowing west, we’ll
have to travel by compass, and save our water as much
as we can. But we’ll go in; see what Percy found,
and maybe find Bates.”</p>

<p>“So that’s where your friend is, is it?” inquired
Mr. Duff, of Terry.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he’s liable to be. But I hope he isn’t.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Mr. Duff. “That country certainly
spells Desolation with a capital ‘D.’”</p>

<p>“I told you before that a jack-rabbit always makes
his will and kisses his family good-by, when he starts
in from the edge of that country,” reminded Sol.</p>

<p>“Do you expect to build a railroad right through,
general?” queried General Rawlins. “No easier
route?”</p>

<p>“None that’s short and of the proper grades. The
mountains block us off, north and south. This is the
natural highway for the rails, I think. The Central
Pacific will have just as bad a desert, in western
Nevada, until we meet them. If we can bring up our
water from behind, while we’re building, we’ll put
the rails across, and sink wells to supply the engines
and stations. I’ll be glad to find that the Percy
Browne surveys are the best for the railroad. The
iron track through, by the trail that he discovered, will
be an eternal monument to his memory.”</p>

<p>Down they all went, into the basin. It was rougher
and even larger than it had seemed from above. There
were many bare red-rock ridges, cutting the surface—many
smaller basins between, white with alkali and
nasty scum; many strange pedestals and figures carved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
by wind and sand; but no water except in poisonous
stagnant pools.</p>

<p>It was no place for George Stanton, or any other
human being.</p>

<p>This first evening they made dry camp. The rocks
and gravel were growing redder; and where after
storms the water had soaked into the soil it left red
washes of caked mud. A weird, glowing landscape
this was, as if blasted by a wizard’s spell.</p>

<p>In the morning the general, Engineer Appleton and
Sol rode to the top of a rock rise, to survey around.
The general peered long through his glasses—handed
them to Mr. Appleton, and Mr. Appleton peered. Sol
squinted.</p>

<p>They turned their horses and came in at a gallop.</p>

<p>“Injun sign out yonder,” cried Sol.</p>

<p>“Colonel! Oh, Colonel Mizner!” summoned the
general. “We’ve sighted what may likely be a party
of Indians, on before. Whether they’ve seen our
camp smoke, I can’t tell. We’ll go ahead, of course;
and if you’ll kindly make arrangements accordingly,
we may wipe out a few scores. I’m sure we’ve got
a good fight in us.”</p>

<p>“I only hope they’ll give us a chance to show it,”
answered the colonel. And—“My compliments to
Lieutenant Wheelan, and tell him I’d like to speak
with him,” he said, to his orderly.</p>

<p>Away ran the orderly. Lieutenant Wheelan was
delighted— “It’s been a long trip without a scrimmage.
The men are famished for a brush or two,”
he cheered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>With wagon train closed up, guarded well, and with
cavalry riding the flanks in compact lines, the march
proceeded. Sol, the colonel, and General Dodge and
General Rawlins held the advance.</p>

<p>“How far are those beggars, I wonder,” said young
Mr. Duff. “Bet they’ll run away.”</p>

<p>“Only ten miles, but the glasses could scarcely pick
them out, among the rocks,” replied Mr. Appleton.</p>

<p>“The general sees ’em again!”</p>

<p>The advance had halted, to scan with the glasses.
Sol galloped back.</p>

<p>“They aren’t Injuns. They’re white men, and act
like they’re in trouble. They’re afoot an’ leading
hosses. Fetch on yore water, for we’ll probably need
it.”</p>

<p>“There’s the Bates party, I’ll wager,” rapped Mr.
Corwith; and all dashed forward.</p>

<p>General Dodge and Major Dunn had forged ahead,
but Terry, wild with fears, pelted close after. The
horses’ hoofs rang on the rocks, and thudded in the
reddish sand and gravel.</p>

<p>The slowly toiling figures were down, flat, as if
exhausted; one struggled to get up, staggered blindly,
and fell again. The general arrived first, was off his
horse in a jiffy, to kneel and raise the figure against
him. He quickly unsnapped his canteen, and poured
from it and dabbled with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>“To the next, major,” he ordered. “I’ll take care
of this one.”</p>

<p>But with a cry Terry stopped short, and tumbled
off. The figure against the general’s knees was George
Stanton!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>Yes, George Stanton—and his own mother
scarcely would have recognized him. However, Terry
knew George; a fellow learns not to be mistaken in
his brother or his chum.</p>

<p>“That’s George Stanton, general!” he gasped.
“That’s my pardner—the boy I’ve talked about. Is
he dead? George! Hello, George!”</p>

<p>“No, not dead; but pretty near gone, from thirst.
This must be the Bates party, then. You tend to him—keep
his face and mouth wet, but don’t give him
too much water, at once. He’ll be all right, soon. I’ll
pass along to the others.”</p>

<p>Terry took charge—holding George tenderly,
shoulders up, off the hard rock and hot sand, and sopping
his face and dribbling into his half open mouth.</p>

<p>Once, George had been a wiry, snappy, black-eyed
package of nerve; now he was wasted to a framework
of bones, his skin was drawn tight and parched, his
lips were shrunken apart and his tongue, black and
stiff, almost filled the space between.</p>

<p>“George!” Terry repeated. “You’re all right.
We’ve found you. I’m Terry—I’m your old pard
Terry. Swallow this water. There’s plenty more.”</p>

<p>The rest of the advance party had passed along,
to administer first aid. The surgeon and some of the
cavalry arrived.</p>

<p>Doctor Terry, the army surgeon, paused an instant,
beside “Doctor” Terry the amateur, for a swift survey.</p>

<p>“Keep up the work, boy. He’ll be all right—he’s
coming ’round.” He laid finger on George’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
withered wrist, for the pulse. “Good! Pulse regular.
Wet his wrists, occasionally. Who is he?
Know him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He’s George Stanton—the other boy
I was looking for.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! That’s luck, sure.” And on passed
the doctor.</p>

<p>George’s eyeballs rolled, his lids fluttered, and he
groaned. He clutched for the canteen.</p>

<p>“Not yet, old fellow. I’m tending to you. Too
much at once might make you sick.”</p>

<p>George stared up, vacantly; then he actually grinned,
as his head swayed.</p>

<p>“Where you come from?” he asked, thickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, just riding through, looking for you. You’re
found.”</p>

<p>“Water. More. Darn it, lemme drink,” complained
George. That was exactly like him—peppery
and obstinate.</p>

<p>Beyond, the General Dodge squad and the soldiers
were working over other members of the survey party,
who had been scattered in a straggled line across the
desert. George wriggled and groaned more and more,
and suddenly sat up, of himself.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you let me drink?” he scolded.</p>

<p>“You have been drinking, George.”</p>

<p>“It never got down. It soaked in part way.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask the doctor.”</p>

<p>Surgeon Terry was coming back, on a tour of inspection.</p>

<p>“Aha! How’s the boy now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“He wants to drink.”</p>

<p>“Ten swallows. And in five minutes another ten
swallows. Will that suit?”</p>

<p>George nodded and eagerly reached for the canteen.</p>

<p>“I’ll count, and at ten you quit,” Terry instructed.</p>

<p>He grabbed the canteen from George’s lips at the
eleventh swallow, and George grudgingly yielded.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mr. Bates? Did you find Mr. Bates?”
he asked, still a bit thickly. “And my dad?”</p>

<p>“Yes. They’re coming ’round. They’ve asked
after you, too. You’re all going to be all right.
Tongue more limber, eh? What happened to you fellows?
Get lost?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” George confessed. “Trying to run
a line across—for railroad—no water—no water ’t
all—three days—awful dry——” and his voice fell
off. “Don’t I get ’nother drink?” he wailed.</p>

<p>“Let him have it,” bade the doctor, and turned back.</p>

<p>It was the grandest thing in the world to watch
George drink, and drink, and swell with the moisture,
and grow stronger.</p>

<p>“Whew!” he sighed, rubbing his eyes. “I was
like an old buffalo carcass lying out for a year or two.
Nothing but hide and bones. Now I’m loosening up.
Golly, but I’m glad to see you. We all thought we
were goners, except Mr. Bates. He said we’d get
through, but he was worse off than any of us. I was
sorry for dad. Wish I could see ’em. How far’s
the railroad in?”</p>

<p>“It’s past Julesburg.”</p>

<p>“Old Julesburg?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“Yes, but we made another Julesburg, north of the
river. It’s a ‘roaring town,’ too. You ought to see
it. Toughest town yet.”</p>

<p>“Thought you were hauling rails.”</p>

<p>“So I was. But I came on with General Dodge,
exploring and to fight Injuns—and to find you fellows.
He invited me because—well, just because.
He says he’ll open the way. We’ve got two companies
of cavalry and Sol Judy.”</p>

<p>“Sol? Say, I want to see Sol. Had any fights?”</p>

<p>“One big one, when we were laying rails between
North Platte and Julesburg. They didn’t get us,
though. And we had another at Plum Creek, only
it wasn’t a fight; it was plain massacre.”</p>

<p>“What were you doing down there?”</p>

<p>“I’d gone for a ride on the road, in a special train.
Got as far as Kearney, and who do you think I
found? Harry! He’s lightning-shooter there. So I
stopped off. Then I started back on a handcar with
some linemen. And this side of Plum Creek the
Cheyennes wrecked us in the dark. They just slung
us every which-way, and killed three of the men and
scalped Bill Thompson (he was head lineman), and
corralled him and Shep and me—and then one of ’em
killed Shep in a hand-to-hand fight when Shep was
protecting us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the dickens!” George mourned. “I’m awful
sorry about Shep. Did you get the Injun?” That
also was just like the spunky George!</p>

<p>“Naw. How could I? They’d wrecked a train,
too—a freight. We had to lie and watch ’em do it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
Then the soldiers from McPherson came down and the
Injuns skipped. But Sol Judy and a soldier and I
buried old Shep. We saved <i>his</i> scalp, anyway; and
his motto is: ‘Killed in action.’”</p>

<p>“You surely have a lot to tell me,” George asserted.
“Seems as though you’ve been having most of the
fun and hard work both. How’s your father?”</p>

<p>“He’s fine. He’s running 119, and I’m running
Jenny, when I’m there.”</p>

<p>“How many miles of track have you laid? A hundred?”</p>

<p>“I left the job at Julesburg, to come on this trip.
We’d laid only about ninety miles, account of storms
and Injuns. Reckon by now they’ve laid a hundred
more. The rails’ll be on top the Black Hills pass,
by fall—maybe down to Fort Sanders, before winter,
the general says.”</p>

<p>“That’s certainly hustling,” George praised. “I’d
like to be there and help, for a spell. All I’ve done
is to drive stakes and carry chain. You’ve had the
big end.” This sounded queer, when he’d been out
here in the desert and had nearly died. “We’ll beat
the Central Pacific, won’t we? If only we get across
this desert——”</p>

<p>“Aw, we will,” Terry asserted. “Nothing can
stop us. And over the mountains and into Salt Lake,
and keep going. The Irish’ll beat the Chinks.”</p>

<p>“Guess <i>so</i>! But we’ve the long way. We’ll have
to lay two miles of track to their one.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! The U. P. track and grading gangs
work like soldiers,” Terry scoffed. “They’re on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
toes, and they’ve got system. We’ll finish up, this
year, 500 miles from Omaha; then we’ll have only
about 500 more to Salt Lake. We’ll get there by
1870, sure. Five hundred miles in two years is nothing,
to the U. P. gangs. Did you fellows have any
Injun trouble?”</p>

<p>“Not much. Mainly water trouble. The last
water we found was poison—made us awful sick;
and Mr. Bates has been trying to run by compass
straight east, out of here, before we all died on him.
We’ve lost a pile of horses and mules; but we’ve got
one wagon, still, somewhere behind. If any Injuns
had come, they’d have had an easy time.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Terry admitted. “The Sioux wiped
out Percy Browne. Did you hear?”</p>

<p>“No! Aw, thunder!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Three hundred of ’em corralled him and
eight soldiers, in this same basin. They shot him,
and the soldiers carried him clear to LaClede stage
station, but he died. Mr. Appleton, his assistant, is
with us now. We met him back at the North
Platte.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon we’re lucky,” sighed George.
“We did hate to quit the survey, though. Come on.
I want to see dad and Mr. Bates and Sol Judy.”</p>

<p>The General Dodge squad and the soldiers were
collecting the Bates men into a central spot, for noon
camp. The few horses and mules had been given
bucketfuls of water, and had perked up. Terry lent
George an arm, and they went in, themselves.</p>

<p>George’s father was sitting up, wan and weak but
getting O. K.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“Hello, dad. I’m ’round before you are,” George
challenged, gaily.</p>

<p>“So I see,” Mr. Stanton retorted. “But you’re
smaller. It doesn’t take so much water to fill you.
How are you, Terry? Think you’d like a survey
job, eh?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” Terry confessed. “’Tisn’t all a picnic,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“I told you about the jack-rabbit and his canteen,
didn’t I?” reminded Sol Judy, as he shook hands
heartily with George.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates—Thomas F. Bates, called “Tom” by
those who knew him—was not only the chief of
the party but also head engineer of the whole Pacific
Division of the company. He had recovered enough
to talk.</p>

<p>“By what you’ve seen of the Bates party, and by
what you’ve heard and seen of the Browne party, you
all will appreciate the stuff that our engineer corps
is composed of, gentlemen,” General Dodge was
proudly saying. “Yes, and some of the difficulties
connected with these advance surveys. Winter and
summer the men are out, and they never know from
day to day what is before them. But I’ve yet to
learn of a coward among them, from the chief down
to the greenest stake-driver. What are your plans
now, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I mean to check up, sir, and revise my notes; and
then if you’ll lend us a little water we’ll run our lines.”</p>

<p>“Your year’s work is done, if you say so,” offered
the general. “You ought to take a rest. You’d better
go on into Fort Sanders, to check your notes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“No, sir.” And Engineer Bates smiled out of a
haggard face. “It’s early in the season. I’ll have
to travel light, but I want to run our lines. I’ll have
plenty more checking over to do, this winter.”</p>

<p>The general’s eyes flashed, but he pondered.</p>

<p>“All right. Just as you say, Tom. I’ll give you
a wagon or two, and a small escort—eh, colonel?”</p>

<p>“By all means, sir,” nodded Colonel Mizner.</p>

<p>“But you’d better cut down your force, Tom.”</p>

<p>“How much, general?”</p>

<p>“This boy George is too young for another spell
of desert work. He ought to go out, for a rest, and
then on to the railroad. I’ll send some dispatches
back, for General Casement.”</p>

<p>“Aw——!” George blurted. “Please let me stay.
I’m all right. I——” and with a burst of tears he
collapsed in Terry’s arms, as they sat.</p>

<p>“Humph! Fainted,” murmured Doctor Terry, the
army surgeon, sprinting for him. “It’s nothing
serious,” he reported, feeling George’s pulse, and then
working over him. “Weakness. I like his spunk.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” General Dodge declared. “But you
all can see that he ought to go. Can you spare him,
Tom?”</p>

<p>“He’s as good as any man in my outfit, general.
And he’s no quitter. He won’t go unless he’s ordered.
What do you say, Stanton? You’re his father.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton shook his head.</p>

<p>“That makes no difference, sir. He’s a member
of the party. I ask no favors for him. You’re his
chief. He’s stuck it out so far and acted like a man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
But I don’t deny that I’d feel easier, myself, if he was
at work somewhere else, for a change.”</p>

<p>“I’ll order him,” spoke the general, briskly. “I’ll
re-assign him. And the dispatches must go.” His
eyes wandered musingly over his company.</p>

<p>At George’s wail of disappointment, and his collapse,
Terry’s heart had risen chokingly. With sudden
impulse he stood up and saluted.</p>

<p>“I’ll take them and go with George, sir, if you
please. He—we sort of hang together, and he’d feel
better about it, to have me along.”</p>

<p>“Good!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to quit. ’Tisn’t that, sir,” Terry explained
anxiously. “Only—I guess you can get on
without me, and I’ve had a splendid time, and now I
can help George and be back to lay some more rails, to
the Black Hills.”</p>

<p>“You’re a brick, by Jiminy!” exclaimed young Mr.
Duff. “Wish I had a pardner like you. Don’t
know whether we can get along without you, or not.”</p>

<p>“Soldier’s orders, on special duty as dispatch bearer—that
will free you of any suspicion of ‘quitting,’
my boy,” said General Rawlins. “That’s the understanding,
general?”</p>

<p>“Detached service, of course. But he’ll not miss
much, except discomfort. The best part of the trip
lies behind us, unless we get through the desert in
time to cross the mountains before snow.”</p>

<p>When George heard of the plan, he kicked vigorously—not
about himself, any more, but about Terry.
However, Terry only laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“No, sir; I’m the man,” he insisted. “I can be
spared the easiest of anybody, and I’m ready to see
the rails again. We’ll have a lot of fun, on the way.”</p>

<p>Colonel Mizner detached a squad of the cavalry,
under red-faced Sergeant Ryan, for an escort to
Sanders, and by way of Rawlins Springs they backtracked
for the Laramie Plains; one day hove in
sight of Fort Sanders—and Terry pointed before,
with a shout.</p>

<p>“See ’em? Hurrah! The first gang’s across the
pass. Now the rails will follow.”</p>

<p>For southward, at the base of the Black Hills, the
tents of camps glimmered, and a reddish line of upturned
earth showed like a thread. The advance of
the railroad graders were already attacking the new
survey—and, as Terry had cheered, the rails would
soon follow.</p>

<small>MAJOR HURD IN A FIX</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> all, it seemed good to be getting back into the
midst of things again. Now George was all on fire
to hasten ahead, and see the “doings.” So they
stopped for only a night at the outpost of Fort Sanders
on the Laramie River at the western foot of the
Black Hills, twenty-two miles from the summit.</p>

<p>“Colonel Gibbon has directed that I furnish you
with another escort,” said Lieutenant Wanless.</p>

<p>“We don’t need an escort now, lieutenant. The
trail’s plain. There’ll be the graders’ camps,” objected
Terry.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’ll be the Sioux,” smiled the lieutenant.
“They and the Cheyennes are busy—making
their last fight, I guess. They’ve tied up operations
several times since you passed through. Either
you take the escort or you don’t go on.”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” George grumbled, privately. “We
could travel faster alone. I want to see what’s on the
other side of the hills.”</p>

<p>But orders being orders, they set out with a squad
of G Company of the good old Second Cavalry, who
were instructed to land them with the first survey
party going in.</p>

<p>Yes, those were the advance graders, all right—sweaty,
grimy, jovial Irishmen in their red shirts and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
scuffed boots and brogans, just knocking off work for
nooning when the Fort Sanders escort, convoying two
explorers, trotted in.</p>

<p>“An’ where have yez been?” asked the boss, Big
Mike, curiously, of Terry.</p>

<p>“Into the Red Desert with General Dodge, for me,
laying out the trail for you fellows. But my pardner’s
been clear to the Green on the other side.”</p>

<p>“An’ what did yez find?”</p>

<p>“Injuns and desert, Mike. Powerful far between
water, but the road goes through.”</p>

<p>“That kind of a country, is it?” Mike sighed, and
puffed at his stubby black pipe. “Ah, well; for the
Injuns we don’t care a rap, b’ gorry; an’ as for the
wather, sure we’ll take wan big drink when we start
in an’ another when we get out. Lucky for the road
that ’tain’t dependin’ on them Chinymen, who have
to have their tay three times a day. For it’s hard
to make tay widout wather.”</p>

<p>“What’s doing eastward, Mike?”</p>

<p>“Work—an’ work ag’in. But ye’d better stay
hereabouts this night. There’s nothin’ in the pass
yet. We’re waitin’ for powder for the blastin’, so’s
to lay the roadbed in the rock.”</p>

<p>“Have the rails reached Cheyenne?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. They hadn’t reached it whin I lift, but
the people had. ’Tis another town started, an’ before
winter ’twill be roarin’, for the rails are comin’ fast an’
all the toughs from Julesburg’ll follow.”</p>

<p>They camped this night with the next grading camp,
at the foot of the pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“The powder’s on its way front Julesburg,” reported
the gang boss. “Engineer Hurd’s fetchin’ it
from end o’ track—an’ supplies, too. Orders be
to work till the snows stop us. Did yez hear tell,
out west, where the Cintral is by this time?”</p>

<p>“About two months ago they were on the east side
of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, and
coming on down. That’s what the telegraph operator
at Green River stage station said,” answered George.
“They’ve got 10,000 Chinese coolies!”</p>

<p>“An’ while they’re a-comin’ down we’re a-comin’
up, aye? We’ll see if thray-dollar-a-day Christians
can’t bate a-dollar-a-day haythen.”</p>

<p>Before the next noon, from the Sherman Summit
they craned eagerly to catch the first view of the wide
land before. Gradually it unfolded, as they wound
over and entered the downward trail—and on a sudden
Terry uttered a sharp cry of amazement.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar’s ghost! Look at Cheyenne.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Down yonder. See that bunch of whity dots and
rusty roofs, away, ’way off. It’s Cheyenne, I bet.
Gee! And when we came through in July there
wasn’t anything.”</p>

<p>The air was still and marvelously clear; in straight
line as the crow flies, one might see miles and miles—seemed
as though one could see to Omaha, the beginning
of track—and one probably could, “if,”
as Sol Judy would say, “he only looked far enough!”</p>

<p>At any rate, on the brownish plain twenty-five miles
by air-line there was smoke, black and blue, and a collection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
of the whity and browny dots betokening a
town.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; there’s what they call Cheyenne, the
‘Magic City of the Plains,’” quoth Corporal Williams.
“Two months old, with a thousand people, and a
town government already, and a daily paper being
started, and the telegraph almost through up from
Denver, and coal mines staked off, and lots that the
railroad company sold for $150 fetching $2000 and
better. She’s a hummer.”</p>

<p>“How near are the rails?” demanded Terry.
That was the important matter.</p>

<p>“Fifty miles out yet. The Injuns have bothered
a heap—corralling the graders and crews and running
off stock. But those Irish keep at it, between
times. Maybe if your eyes are good you can see the
smoke of the construction-train, against the horizon.”</p>

<p>“Is Cheyenne as tough as Julesburg?” asked
George.</p>

<p>The corporal laughed.</p>

<p>“Wait till the pay-car comes on, along with end of
track. That graveyard the Injuns planted will be
’tended to by the white men. She’s grown already.”</p>

<p>Down the slope of the pass and to Cheyenne the
grade was marked, and knots of ants were busy—but
not ants, they were men, of course. As for the smoke
of the construction-train, no one could be certain that
he saw it, from this distance. However, it was there,
seventy-five miles distant, at end o’ track; and mile
by mile, this very day, it was drawing nearer.</p>

<p>You could trust in Paddy Miles for that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“Squad, halt,” barked the corporal. “Dismount.
We’ll make noon camp, boys. By evening we’ll meet
that wagon train, yonder, and learn the news. I expect
there’ll be some surveyors I can leave you with,
on the right o’ way, who’ll pass you along. The orders
are for me to get back to Sanders as quick as ever
I can.”</p>

<p>Another gang of graders were passed, on the downward
trail, after the noon hour. They were digging
a cut—wielding their shovels lustily, and throwing
the dirt and gravel out upon the dump, while their
stacked guns stood near, and the ploughs and scrapers
clattered.</p>

<p>“Drill, you tarriers, drill!” daringly shouted Terry,
as with George and the cavalry squad he rode along
the line. But only two or three of the men lifted
face, to stare and wipe their brows; the rest stuck to
the job as if they had no time for nonsense.</p>

<p>Now there was an interval of a couple of miles; and
then a little crew of surveyors, checking a grade already
leveled. They worked with revolvers hanging
at their waists, and picked up their rifles and blanket-rolls
whenever they moved on with level and transit.</p>

<p>“Where’s your camp, boys?” queried the corporal.</p>

<p>“Anywhere we spread our beds, corporal. We
bunk and eat with the grading gangs, mostly. You’ll
likely find a real camp further on, before night.”</p>

<p>There was another interval, of five or six miles—and
then the wagon train. It was moving slowly—a
dozen of the great white-canvassed freighter wagons,
a number of trudging teamsters, a handful of riders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
ambling at the head, and a cavalry company guarding
the rear and scouting in the fore.</p>

<p>“Supplies from headquarters, I reckon,” spoke the
corporal. “Fetching up that powder and some provisions,
like as not.”</p>

<p>The two parties approached each other. Jones, the
big “buck” private riding behind Terry and George
and the corporal, exclaimed shortly:</p>

<p>“Those ain’t the regular cavalry; they’re some o’
them Pawnee scouts.”</p>

<p>“Yes—and they see something, too.” Corporal
Williams’ voice issued tensely. “Close up, men.
Draw—carbines! That looks like hostiles, somewhere
around.”</p>

<p>“I see ’em!” George yelped. “Down to the south!
Making ’round that point of hills.”</p>

<p>“And watch those Pawnees go after ’em!” ejaculated
Corporal Williams. “Squad, halt! Steady,
men, till we see what’s what.”</p>

<p>The wagon train, about two miles before, had
changed formation in a hurry. Its escort had suddenly
bunched, and now were streaming furiously
across country, in wild charge upon another bunch
of horsemen skirting the range of hills on the south.
The Pawnee yells might be heard faintly, as the
scouts urged their ponies with their quirts and heels,
and wrestled out of their clothes as they rode.</p>

<p>The quarry had seen, as quickly. They were fifty—Indians,
sure, driving a herd of stock.</p>

<p>“Sioux, I bet yuh!” rapped the corporal. “Robbed
a graders’ camp. I see more of the beggars, too—those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
hills are full of ’em. But look at those Pawnees!
Never think of the wagon train, they don’t. Plumb
left it, set on getting scalps. It’s corralling. Squad,
’tenshun! For’d, march! Trot! Gallop! We’d
better get there while we can, boys.”</p>

<p>Away they dashed. The train had corralled, in
a complete circle of wagons, wheel to wheel and the
teams turned inside. The ground there was rough
and rocky, among rises. “Granite Canyon” it was
called, after the railroad grade had been blasted
through.</p>

<p>The Pawnees were still scurrying; the Sioux had
defiantly paused, as though to give battle. If while
they fought, the other Sioux came down—well,
there’d be considerable trouble.</p>

<p>“They’ll not cut us off, now,” declared Corporal
Williams. “They’re a little too leary.”</p>

<p>And with horses blowing the squad tore in, to the
corralled train.</p>

<p>“This way! Here’s a hole for you.” They were
inside.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you.” It was Major Marshall Hurd
himself, the principal engineer assistant to Mr. Reed,
superintendent of construction. “What do you think
of my Pawnees?”</p>

<p>“They’re keen on a fight, sir. Just show ’em some
Sioux, and away they go; but they don’t wait orders,”
laughed the corporal.</p>

<p>“Hardly.” And Engineer Hurd smiled grimly.
“There were no white officers with this bunch, to hold
’em, and away they went. Now here we are, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
wagon train of powder and provisions, and no guard.
Station your men, corporal, where they can help the
teamsters. We’ll put up a white man’s fight, and the
Pawnees can go hang. Colonel Seymour, you take
command of this side of the corral, if you please,
and show your Civil War training. I’ll take command
of the other side. These boys——”</p>

<p>“Hello!” Colonel Silas Seymour (for it was he,
again, evidently on another trip to the Black Hills)
addressed Terry. “You’re back, are you? Where
did you leave the general?”</p>

<p>“In the Red Desert, sir. He and the rest of the
party are with the Bates party, but he sent my pardner
and me in with dispatches for General Casement.”</p>

<p>“All right. You’ll find General Casement at Cheyenne.
They’re still doing business with end o’ track.
I saw your old yellow mule, and one of the Muldoons
on her back. Now you and your partner crawl
under a wagon and help out. Grab a gun apiece.
You can shoot? Good!”</p>

<p>The Pawnees had disappeared; and although the
wagon corral waited all the afternoon, they did not
return—did not come even into sight, again!</p>

<p>Several other Sioux were to be seen, in the rough
country north of the line. They seemed to be spying.
They did not venture nearer, but Major Hurd
was wise enough not to open the corral; all along the
line the graders’ camps, if they knew about the enemy,
were playing safe, too.</p>

<p>Dusk settled, and still there was no sign of the Pawnees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“This will never do,” finally Major Hurd declared.
“We’re only twenty miles from Cheyenne, and the
whole line is being held up. I hate to spare a single
man, but we’ll have to send back for an escort, colonel.
I can’t risk taking this train on, without better protection.
It’s too valuable a prize.”</p>

<p>“You can detail a couple of those soldiers, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“We may need them; but it can’t be helped.
Where’s the corporal? I’ll——”</p>

<p>George nudged Terry, and Terry understood. He
stood forward and saluted.</p>

<p>“We’ll go, major. We’re carrying dispatches anyway.”</p>

<p>“You two boys? I don’t doubt you’d do as well as
anybody, if the Indians didn’t get after you, but in
a case like this——”</p>

<p>“Aw, shucks!” blurted George, who wasn’t much
on military discipline. “We’re used to Injuns.
’Tisn’t far, Mr. Hurd. Only twenty miles. Injuns
wouldn’t see us any quicker than they would anybody
else. We’ve ridden worse trails than that.”</p>

<p>“And we’ve got General Dodge’s dispatches, too,”
added Terry. “Wish you’d let us go, sir.”</p>

<p>“I expect they could make it as well as two men,
major,” put in Colonel Seymour. “That is, if they’re
as smart as they think they are.”</p>

<p>“We’re smart enough to fool Injuns,” asserted
George. “Anyway, we’re not afraid.”</p>

<p>“You’re a likely pair,” said Major Hurd, abruptly.
“I’ll chance your getting through. You’ll start at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
midnight. That’ll bring you there by daylight. I’ll
give you a dispatch for the military commander at
new Fort Russell. There’ll be several graders’ camps
along the way—but you’d better keep out from them
if you can, or somebody’ll take a shot at you. If
you’re driven into one, then halloo in good English
before you arrive.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I don’t believe we’ll need any help,
though,” answered Terry; and George proclaimed:</p>

<p>“Sure not. We’ll not stop for help. Injuns don’t
bother in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Terry replied. “Don’t they, these days?
You ought to have been with us at Plum Creek!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>TWO ON THE SCOUT TRAIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> left shortly after midnight, with Major Hurd’s
dispatch tucked inside Terry’s shirt along with the
General Dodge letters. The men of the wagon corral,
except the sentries, were asleep, but Colonel Seymour
had stayed up. He and the major shook hands
with the two couriers.</p>

<p>“Good luck to you. We’ll depend on your sending
that escort and opening the line again.”</p>

<p>“What was that General Dodge said? Boys are
mighty handy, sometimes—wasn’t it?” George
chuckled, as they rode away.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” agreed Terry. “But this is nothing.
All we’ve got to do is to keep going—same as
the railroad.”</p>

<p>“Can’t hurry, though, and kick up a fuss,” warned
George. “Sure and steady, is the word, boy. We
want to steer clear of those graders’ camps, too.
They shoot first and ask questions afterward.”</p>

<p>“You bet.”</p>

<p>The plains before stretched wide and lonesome in
spite of the railroad work. On either side of the survey
stakes and the few graders’ camps it lay for hundreds
of miles, by day broken with uplifts and ravines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
and ridges, but by night shrouded all in mystery, and
looking all the same.</p>

<p>Above, the bright stars studded the black; below,
there were no landmarks, except the upturned earth
where the graders’ ploughs and picks and spades had
followed the stakes. And frequently there was not
even this, when the work had been interrupted or postponed.</p>

<p>The horses traveled, with ears pricked, at fast walk.
Their hoofs occasionally clinked on a stone; and again
were muffled in the sand and sod. The canteens now
and then jingled, the saddle leather squeaked, one
horse or the other blew snortingly. But the silence of
the night, in such a country, was too big to be disturbed
by such small noises.</p>

<p>However, with a good horse under him, and a Spencer
repeating carbine across his saddle horn, and a
stanch chum by his side, and a trail to which he was
used, before him, a fellow need not feel afraid.</p>

<p>They jogged on. The darkness was not the thick
kind; it never is, in the clear night in the great open.
The graded trail loomed blackly, and warned by his
glowing eyes they once or twice glimpsed a coyote
slip away, like a shadow.</p>

<p>They tried to parallel the railroad survey, until,
after they had ridden for an hour, maybe, in the distance
ahead they heard a dog barking.</p>

<p>“Graders’ camp, huh!” George grunted.</p>

<p>“Yep. Can’t be Injuns. Injuns wouldn’t camp
along the right o’ way. Not when the Pawnees are
out after ’em. We’d better branch off and go ’round.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Right you are. Edge off, toward the North Star.”</p>

<p>So they veered from the due east and catty-cornered
in the direction of the North Star.</p>

<p>“Keep it between chin and shoulder. That’ll take
us ’round, I reckon, and we’ll know how far to turn
back in,” Terry directed.</p>

<p>“Aw, we couldn’t miss the railroad grades, anyway,”
George scoffed.</p>

<p>“A fellow can miss almost anything, at night, unless
he’s mighty careful.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t miss Cheyenne, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is a big country, just the same.”</p>

<p>They rode and rode. The barking of the dog had
quit. They were surely past the graders’ camp; it
was high time to turn in. George suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, up yonder? Blame it, the
sky’s clouding. Can’t scarcely see the North Star,
now.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. It’s light enough down here, though.
Doesn’t feel like a storm.”</p>

<p>“No; but how’ll we keep direction?”</p>

<p>“Guess at it. If we travel in a straight line as
we’re heading, we’ll strike the grade somewhere.”</p>

<p>Terry turned more sharply, to make certain, and
they rode. They rode—and they rode, with eyes
keen to catch the first traces of the railroad survey.</p>

<p>“Do you reckon we’ve crossed it?”</p>

<p>“No. It’s in front of us. Must be.”</p>

<p>“Wish some dog would bark,” George complained.
“Let’s stop a minute.”</p>

<p>They stopped, and listened. They did not hear a
sound.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THE TWO SCOUTS IN A FIX</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“I’ll be darned!” George grumbled. “Just when
we need a dog, he doesn’t bark. And there’s not a
single star in the whole blamed sky. How can a fellow
travel by night without stars?”</p>

<p>“Injuns can.”</p>

<p>“Well, we aren’t Injuns.”</p>

<p>“So could Jim Bridger, I bet you.”</p>

<p>“So could I, if I knew where I was going,” retorted
George.</p>

<p>“Keep going.”</p>

<p>“Keep going,” George echoed.</p>

<p>They rode. The horses no longer pricked up their
ears; they plodded with only an occasional shying off
from unexpected objects, but otherwise did not take
much interest. That was a bad sign. The country
under foot seemed to be growing rougher. A deep
gully cut the blind trail, and had to be followed for a
piece, until the horses plunged in, and out again.</p>

<p>Terry reined, and spoke.</p>

<p>“Either we’re lost or the grade’s lost.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! We’re hefty scouts, to lose a railroad
line.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t have lost it, if the sky hadn’t clouded
over. And we haven’t any compass.”</p>

<p>“Next time we’ll ride right through any graders’
camp and let ’em shoot,” declared George. “What
had we better do? Keep going?”</p>

<p>“Seems to me we’re headed nearly right, anyhow,”
mused Terry. “I don’t think that gully threw us
off, much. These horses are liable to take us somewhere
if we give ’em the rein—liable to take us to
a camp or into Cheyenne.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“Maybe they don’t know about Cheyenne.”</p>

<p>“Gwan!” bade Terry, to his mount; and they rode
on again, through the stillness and the monotonous
dusk.</p>

<p>After what might have been a long time, of plodding
and stumbling and rasping through brush and
over rocks, the horses halted, of themselves, at the
base of a steep slope which slanted up into the night.
Their riders peered, and hope died.</p>

<p>“We’re plumb lost, for sure,” growled George.
“There’s no railroad grade here; it’s somewhere else.
Which way’s east, I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t this way. We must be north of the grade,
still. We’d better follow along this hill, and strike
in another direction. Come on.”</p>

<p>They rode (the horses were glad not to climb) and
leaving the slope they presently arrived against another
slope, in the new direction.</p>

<p>“Say! The farther we go the farther we are from
anywhere,” George flatly declared. “I vote we quit
till daylight. Then we can see something. This
blundering about and getting no place isn’t any fun.”</p>

<p>“W-well,” sighed Terry, “I reckon you’re right,
boy. Might as well save our hosses. But I hate to
give in.”</p>

<p>So did George. Still, as he had said, they weren’t
getting any place with all their riding. He plumped
from the saddle, and fumbled at his picket rope.</p>

<p>“What you doing?”</p>

<p>“Going to picket this horse, and take a snooze.”</p>

<p>He was practical, George was; nothing phazed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“All right. Leave the saddles on, though, and the
bits in, so we can mount in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>“You talk sense, pard,” George answered broadly.</p>

<p>They picketed their horses close within reach, and
snuggled down like old campaigners.</p>

<p>“When the sky gets light, we’ll know where the east
is, then, sure,” remarked Terry.</p>

<p>“Yes; and we may find ourselves right close to the
grade, or we may be a thousand miles from nowhere,”
George sleepily murmured. “Br-r! Wish we’d
brought a blanket.”</p>

<p>The night was chill. Terry grew colder and colder,
and shivered. He hunched up, longing for daybreak—he
nodded off, and shivered awake. The horses
cropped and snorted; George always could sleep at any
time and at any place, and now began to gurgle. Terry
dozed for short intervals; finally let himself go (there
wasn’t any use in mounting guard, here, over the two
of them); and when again he opened his eyes, the
blackness had paled.</p>

<p>Morning!</p>

<p>He scrambled to his feet, and easily located the
east, by the brightness of the sky there. Birds were
twittering in the brush—hill slopes of sage and
gravel rose on right and left, as the night thinned; but
all the landscape was lonely, without trace of other
human beings. Not even an antelope was in sight.</p>

<p>He shook George.</p>

<p>“Wha’ ’smatter?”</p>

<p>“Morning. Let’s get out of here.”</p>

<p>“I should say!” And George staggered to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
feet. “Did you sleep, too? Where are we, anyhow?”
And he blinked about.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But we’ll hit south as fast as we
can. There’s the east. Once we’re out of these hills,
then we can see something.”</p>

<p>Without wasting time George stumbled for his horse;
they hung the picket ropes to the saddles, swung
aboard, and were on their way again.</p>

<p>“Follow down this draw?”</p>

<p>“Yes. If it doesn’t lead right we’ll climb a hill
and take a look.”</p>

<p>The morning brightened rapidly. The draw seemed
to lead in the right direction. It opened into a rolling
plain—hurrah! And now they saw, far before,
a column of smoke suspended in the still air.</p>

<p>“Camp! There’s the grade!”</p>

<p>“How in thunder did we ever get away out here?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. We ought to have been at Cheyenne
by this time.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll get there now,” asserted George.
“But we’re hefty dispatch-bearers.”</p>

<p>The smoke column was some three miles yonder.
They pushed for it, at a trot—thought that they
could see the line itself, and Terry was just saying:
“Cheyenne can’t be very far, either,” when George’s
voice broke in a little gasp.</p>

<p>“Terry! Injuns! Look quick. We’ll never make
it.”</p>

<p>Terry looked. Quartering on their right, ahead,
out from a low place in the range of bare hills, there,
the Indians were coming, at last. There was no mistake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
about that. They were less than a mile away—they
rode like Indians, they acted like Indians, and
Indians they were, charging full tilt; twenty-five or
thirty of them.</p>

<p>Terry’s heart surged into his throat. A wave of
sickness swept through him. He hauled on the rein.</p>

<p>“Run for it, George. Never mind the grade—they’ll
cut us off. But we’ll beat ’em to Cheyenne.
Got to.”</p>

<p>“Sure have. They may quit.”</p>

<p>“We can fort and fight ’em off, till help comes.
Blame the luck! Major Hurd’s counting on us.”</p>

<p>“Never say die till you’re dead,” panted George.
“Maybe Cheyenne isn’t far. Maybe a graders’ camp
has seen.”</p>

<p>They tore on at best speed. Terry glanced aside,
to measure distance again. The sky in the east had
cleared, and the sun was just launching his first level
rays across the sage. They brought the Indians into
plainer view. The gap between the two, pursuers and
pursued, had narrowed. Those were good ponies as
well as good riders, and the horses were stiff and sluggish.</p>

<p>“Dog-gone! They’re closing in on us,” George
remarked, as if trying to speak matter-of-fact. George
never got rattled, in a pinch. He might be depended
upon, to the last inch.</p>

<p>“Guess they are.” And Terry also tried to speak
cheerfully. “If we could only get to that ridge yonder,
maybe we’d see Cheyenne.”</p>

<p>The Indians were beginning to whoop. Their cries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
wafted shrilly and threateningly—likewise gleefully.
They were between the boys and the distant grade—were
closing in almost parallel. From the grade
nobody was coming, to the rescue. It seemed horrible
to be cut off, this way, and forced to fight for one’s
life, right within sight of other persons—right
within sight of possible help; but that had been the
story of the railroad, to date. The same thing had
occurred along almost every mile of the track, and the
grading, and the surveys.</p>

<p>“When we come to a good place, stop quick.
We’ll have to fight ’em off, George,” spoke Terry.
“We can’t make even the ridge.”</p>

<p>A fellow could always do that, if he was smart:
down his horse, fort behind it, and shoot true.</p>

<p>The yells were louder. The Indians were within
easy range. In a moment the bullets would commence
to sing.</p>

<p>“Now!” rasped Terry—and at the instant George’s
horse stumbled, pitched to his knees, and sent George
flying over its head. Terry reined in a jiffy, tumbled
off, and leveled his carbine across the saddle.</p>

<p>“Give it to ’em. Get up—catch your hoss. I’ll
hold ’em off.”</p>

<p>The sight blurred in his eyes—but the Indians
swerved madly—he saw the nearest lift hand, palm
to the front, heard him shout—and heard George
also.</p>

<p>“Wait! Don’t shoot. They’re Pawnees!”</p>

<p>So they were—the Pawnee scouts, several of them
in army breeches made into leggins. They had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
bunched and halted, the leader (the one with the hand
up) was riding forward, grinning; now the rest followed.
The relief was so great that Terry felt faint
and trembly.</p>

<p>“I suppose they think it’s a great joke,” panted
George. “It’d served ’em right if we’d wiped out
a few of ’em. And we’d have done it, too, in a minute
more.”</p>

<p>The Pawnees evidently did think it a great joke.
They came on laughing and prancing. The leader,
their sergeant, shook hands with Terry, and with the
angry George.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by chasing us, anyhow?”
George demanded.</p>

<p>The sergeant, who wore breeches-leggins with a
commissioned officer’s yellow stripe down their seam,
grinned broadly.</p>

<p>“Heap run,” he chuckled. “No good. Pawnees
ketch ’um, samee Sioux. Make young warriors.
Good boys.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Then Terry found himself smiling,
too. There was no use in being sour over such luck.
“Where you going?”</p>

<p>“Where you go?” answered the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Cheyenne.”</p>

<p>“All right. We go Cheyenne. Come.”</p>

<p>George’s horse was unhurt; they mounted.</p>

<p>“You with Major Hurd?” queried Terry.</p>

<p>“Yes. Chase Sioux; kill heap; many scalps. Take
’um Crow Creek, have big dance.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go back to the wagon train?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
scolded George. “That’s where you belong. What
are you out here chasing white men for?”</p>

<p>“No wagon train. Kill all Sioux, now bring scalps
to soldier chief. Scare white boys, make ’em run.
Hoo-rah!”</p>

<p>The Pawnees were in the highest kind of spirits.
They seemed to think nothing of having left the wagon
train in the lurch, but they thought a whole lot of their
successful fight with the Sioux. Now they were going
back to Crow Creek, or Cheyenne, to celebrate.</p>

<p>Taking the two dispatch-bearers, they laid a straight
course—knew exactly where they were heading.
And sure enough, from the crest of the next little rise
Cheyenne was plain in sight, with the railroad grade
running into its collection of tents and shacks and new
buildings, and through and on east to meet end o’ track.</p>

<p>The first thing to do, of course, was to hustle the
Major Hurd dispatch into the hands of the commanding
officer at the new Fort Russell, which was as yet
only a tent camp outside of town, and leave their
Spencer carbines; then to look up General “Jack”
Casement, and give him the General Dodge dispatches
and report for duty; all before breakfast.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they reached town, from the fort, when
a detachment of cavalry was trotting into the west,
to relieve the Hurd wagon train. That was good.
Now for General Casement.</p>

<p>“It’s shore some town,” George commented, as they
ambled through, curiously inspecting.</p>

<p>And so it was, they were to find out: the “Magic
City of the Plains,” with already over a thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
people, here where three months before there had been
only a bare expanse, and a graveyard of two dead
men; with streets named, and city officers in charge,
and a daily paper, and shingled roofs as well as sheet-iron
and canvas, and several two-story buildings, one
of which, 55 × 25 feet, had been erected of raw rough
lumber from Denver in forty-eight hours!</p>

<p>Luckily, whom should they sight but General Casement
himself, getting this, the new terminal, into
shape to receive the sidings and his warehouse and
all, for end o’ track was only forty miles out and coming
fast.</p>

<p>They vaulted off, where he was talking with Superintendent
Sam Reed. Terry saluted.</p>

<p>“Dispatches from General Dodge, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“Hello! It’s you again, is it? Well! Where’d
you hail from, this time?” demanded the little general.</p>

<p>“From the Red Desert, sir; the both of us. I found
George Stanton—or we all did, I mean, with the
Bates party. The general sent us back.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>General Casement quickly tore open the dispatches,
and read them.</p>

<p>“Very good,” he said. “Had your breakfast?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Had a pleasant trip?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. The Pawnees charged us, to scare us;
but we forted behind our horses and were going to
fight them off, only we didn’t need to.”</p>

<p>“They gave us the peace sign just in time, too,”
George added; “or else they’d have lost some scalps.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
And he wagged his head and growled hostily. “The
laugh would have been on them, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“Hah!” chuckled the little general. “That’s the
talk. You’re the right stuff. You ought to be
corporals, at least. Now what? Ready for work?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’ve got a job at end o’ track,” Terry
answered.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a job somewhere if I can get one,” asserted
George. “I don’t want to loaf.”</p>

<p>“All right. Mr. Reed and I, between us, will see
that you don’t loaf, young man. Nobody loafs, along
the U. P. But first you get breakfast, both of you.
Then you can have till noon. Report to one of us
at noon; if we’re not here, go on out to end o’ track
and find us.”</p>

<p>“Sha’n’t I start in hauling rails again, sir?” Terry
asked.</p>

<p>“You’ll start in at something or other, never fear;
and so shall this other boy. How are you fixed for
funds? Got breakfast money?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t,” George confessed.</p>

<p>“Guess I have,” said Terry.</p>

<p>“Never mind. Here.” And General Casement
scribbled upon a pocket pad and tore off the leaf.
“You take this to the Home Cooking restaurant, two
blocks up and right around the corner to your left.
It’s run by two women—regular white women. It’s
a fine place. I eat there myself, and so does Mr.
Reed.”</p>

<p>“I recommend it without reserve,” Mr. Reed asserted.
“The best cooking this side of Omaha. And
very clean, pleasant women.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>The leaf said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Feed these two boys two big meals each. Charge
to me.</p>

<p class="right">
J. S. Casement, U. P. R. R. &#160; &#160;<br>
(Late Brig. Gen., U. S. V.)</p>
</div>

<p>“Turn your horses in at the Square Deal corral,
for feed and water,” bade General Casement. “Tell
the man I’ll settle for them when I settle for my own.”</p>

<p>“And be sure to try the apple pie,” added Superintendent
Reed. “It’s the real thing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; we will. Thanks very much,” they replied,
replying to all instructions at once.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget the apple pie,” Superintendent Reed
reminded, after them, as they rode away.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose we can get apple pie for breakfast?”
George queried, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I dunno. We can ask. Jiminy! I haven’t had
a piece of real apple pie for a coon’s age,” said Terry.
“We’re in luck, anyhow. We might have had to go
clear to end o’ track without eating.”</p>

<p>“‘Home cooking’ restaurant sounds good to me.
But you can’t always tell. Sometimes those names
are frauds—they don’t pan out. Golly, I’d like to
sit down to regular home cooking again, by women like
my mother.”</p>

<p>“Or like mine. So would I,” agreed Terry. “Men
cooks are all right, but it doesn’t seem to come natural
to ’em. Now a woman, she just slings stuff together
and you never know how it’s going to taste except it’ll
taste exactly right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“That is, if she’s like our mothers,” George persisted.</p>

<p>All Cheyenne was ringing with the sound of busy
hammering, as scores of men labored with might and
main to put up still more buildings. It certainly was
a lively place. They stowed their horses in the Square
Deal, and on foot found the Home Cooking restaurant.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look much,” George criticized, when they
inspected it from the outside.</p>

<p>“’Bout the same as the rest of ’em, only smells kind
of good.” And Terry sniffed.</p>

<p>The Home Cooking restaurant was of canvas walls
boarded part way up, and corrugated sheet-iron roof
painted red, and seemed brand new. A large square
canvas sign hung up in front, with the name on it.
The front door was ajar. Through it there wafted
those odors that had made Terry sniff. Inside there
was hammering and voices.</p>

<p>“Gee, I do smell pie—or something,” George declared,
wrinkling his nose as he drew long breaths.
“Shall we try it?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Come on. We’re not afraid of women,
even if we aren’t washed up.”</p>

<p>So in they clumped. The room was as neat as wax.
There was a long counter with a row of stools in front
of it, and several signs—“Home Coffee,” “Home
Bread,” “Home Doughnuts,” “Home Apple Pie,”
“We Are Ladies. Please Be Gentlemen,” “Remember
Your Mother, Boys.”</p>

<p>A woman in a blue checkered gingham dress was
tacking shiny white oilcloth upon the counter. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
was a part of the hammering. She had her back
turned, and hadn’t heard them enter.</p>

<p>“Please, ma’am, may we get breakfast here?”
Terry asked.</p>

<p>Whew, how good that room smelled!</p>

<p>“Why, I think I can accommodate you,” the woman
answered, speaking through the tacks between her lips.
“We can give you something—we’re just opening
up——” and she took her tacks out and raised her
head, to face them.</p>

<p>“Anything that’s homey, ma’am,” pleaded George.
“We——”</p>

<p>But Terry fairly screeched.</p>

<p>“Ma! Jiminy whillikens! Say—aren’t you my
mother?”</p>

<p>“Why, Terry Richards! What are you doing
here?”</p>

<p>“What are <i>you</i> doing here?” retorted Terry, as
they rushed together and hugged.</p>

<p>“We’re on the U. P., too. We’re——”</p>

<p>From the kitchen another woman hurried in, her
hands all flour, to find out what was going on. And
George shouted and charged.</p>

<p>“There’s <i>my</i> mother. Hooray!”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake!”</p>

<p>“Never mind your hands, ma. I’m dirty, anyhow.”</p>

<p>And she didn’t; he didn’t, either.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well! We thought one of you was
out at end of track and the other was surveying.”</p>

<p>“So we were. We just got into town. And we
thought you were down at Denver.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“So we were. And we’ve just got in, too—only
two or three days ago. We’ve hardly opened up for
business, yet.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Run a nice little restaurant.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t, ma,” Terry objected. “These
railroad towns are awful tough towns, at first.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we can. As soon as the men find out that
we’re ladies, and serve such good food, they’ll treat
us all right, we’re sure. We haven’t had a bit of
trouble, so far. We won’t serve a great variety, but
what we do serve will be real home cooking.”</p>

<p>“Does dad know about it?”</p>

<p>“Not a word, and I don’t want him to know till
the track gets here. Then we’ll surprise him.”</p>

<p>“But, ma! We’ll all be going on again. We won’t
be here very long, maybe. You both can’t stay in
Cheyenne, running a restaurant.”</p>

<p>“We don’t intend to,” laughed his mother, briskly.
“We’re going on with you—clear through, with the
U. P. Aren’t we, Mrs. Stanton!”</p>

<p>“Indeed we are. We’ll hire somebody to pack our
things, each time the town moves. And at every new
town you boys and your fathers (I only hope George’s
father will be near) will know just where to get something
good to eat. Oh, we’ll watch after you.”</p>

<p>Now there was another interruption. She was a
girl, George’s sister. He called her his “little” sister,
but she was growing faster than he.</p>

<p>“Hello, Virgie!”</p>

<p>Virgie stared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“It’s no fair!” she accused. “We aren’t ready.
We wanted to surprise you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say you did surprise us,” Terry
comforted. “We didn’t know what the Home Cooking
restaurant was.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Shep?” Virgie asked.</p>

<p>Terry sobered.</p>

<p>“We’ll tell you about Shep. We’ve got a lot to
tell.”</p>

<p>“Do we have pie for breakfast, ma?” prompted
George. “General Casement gave us a meal pass,
for here; and Superintendent Reed said to be sure to
try the apple pie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, those two men!” scoffed Mrs. Stanton.
“They’ve almost eaten us out. Yes, you can have
apple pie for breakfast, if you want it. Luckily we’ve
got some fresh in the oven.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we smelled, George,” Terry exclaimed
triumphantly.</p>

<p>“We leave the door open on purpose, when we’re
cooking,” explained Virgie.</p>

<p>“Do you like Cheyenne, Virgie?” Terry asked, as
the two mothers bustled to gather breakfast together.</p>

<p>“No; it’s too dirty and noisy. But I sha’n’t stay
here. When Uncle Ralph (that was Terry’s father)
brings his engine in, I’m going to ride up and down
the track on it, all the time.”</p>

<p>“Breakfast will be ready in a minute,” called his
mother. “You can wash out here in the kitchen;
and you and George can be telling us about your
fathers and about yourselves, and everything.”</p>

<small>SET FOR THE GREAT RACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">End o’ track</span>, again! With the secret of the
Home Cooking restaurant kept close from Engine
Driver Richards; with Pat Miles urging the work,
and the red-shirted, gray-shirted, blue-shirted Irish
track-layers and spikers and ballasters sweating, and
the sledges whanging, and the truck-loads of rails
hauled by Jimmie Muldoon and brother astride horse
and yellow mule rumbling up, and the puffing construction-train
constantly elbowing the boarding-train
out of the way, and the cheery song breaking forth
ever and anon:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Drill, my paddies, drill!</div>
<div class="verse">Drill, you tarriers, drill!</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, it’s work all day,</div>
<div class="verse">No sugar in your tay—</div>
<div class="indent">Wor-rkin’ on th’ U. Pay. Ra-a-ailway!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“So it’s fur out into the desert yez have been,
is it?” asked Pat, at lay-off the first evening.</p>

<p>“That’s what, Pat.”</p>

<p>“An’ nigh died, one o’ yez. Well, well! Is that
the kind o’country? But no matter. Yez didn’t see
anything o’ the Cintral, did yez?”</p>

<p>“We should say not! They’re still in California,
more than a thousand miles west.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Sure, what’s a thousand miles, to a U. Pay. man?
First thing they know, we’ll be bumpin’ their Chiny
dagoes off’n the right o’ way. Is it true they got
10,000 of ’em a-workin’ wid white man’s picks an’
shovels?”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder, Pat.”</p>

<p>Pat sighed.</p>

<p>“Ah, well. Nobody but an Irishman can handle a
pick—yes, an’ a shillaly, too. Wid them two weapons
we’ll dig to Chiny itself. We’ve had a hard time wid
the Injuns, since you left, Terry, me boy; but now
we’re hittin’ our stride ag’in an’ we’ll not stop till we’re
atop them Black Hills yonder, where we can take a
squint over at the country beyant.”</p>

<p>The rails went forward, but Terry had found himself
promoted from rail-hauler on the back of old
yellow Jenny (and he did hate to leave Jenny) to
time-checker on the back of a horse: his business to
ride along among the work-gangs and get their time,
for report to the Casement pay-master.</p>

<p>And George was settled as a clerk in the pay-car
that weekly trundled up and back.</p>

<p>The Indian troubles were thought to be quieted. A
big treaty council had been held, and another was to
follow, between the Sioux and Cheyennes and the
United States. At any rate, the job of riding the line
and visiting the near grading-camps was not so dangerous
as it might have been earlier in the season. Also,
it was very pleasant, when Cheyenne and the Home
Cooking restaurant drew nearer to end o’ track.</p>

<p>The rails were marching on. Thirty miles to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
Cheyenne, twenty miles to Cheyenne, fifteen miles to
Cheyenne, and ten, and five and two—and one more
day’s work and there they’d be.</p>

<p>There they were, on November 13, this 1867: planting
mile-post 517, and welcomed by a great crowd,
and a band, and a lot of flags and bunting, with the
Lincoln car carrying the Government inspectors pressing
after and accepting the track as far as mile-post
490, only some twenty-five miles behind. Yes, it was
a well-built road.</p>

<p>This evening Terry guided his father up-town, and
another reunion occurred, celebrated with plenty of pie
and hot doughnuts.</p>

<p>Into the new terminal station the telegraph poles
advanced. The pay-car moved up, bringing the eager
George. Then came the procession: Casement
Brothers’ take-down warehouse and offices, and the
gamblers’ tents and the side-shows and saloons, which
had been only waiting, at Julesburg. Cheyenne rapidly
swelled to 3,000 people, for now the news had passed
that it was to be the winter quarters of the railroad.
The Overland Stage changed its terminal, also, to keep
with the gang, and put on a run between Denver and
Cheyenne.</p>

<p>There was nothing but the station left at Julesburg,
the five months “wickedest town in America”: nothing
but the station and a mess of cans and other rubbish.
Cheyenne, the “Magic City of the Plains,” had
swallowed it.</p>

<p>On the very next day after the arrival of end o’
track, the passenger trains began to roll in. The first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
brought a brimming excursion from the East. This
meant another jollification, with speeches by the mayor
and by Mr. Sidney Dillon, president of the U. P.
board of directors, and by little General Casement,
“champion track-layer of the continent,” and others.
Town lots that the company had sold for $150 were
being resold for as high as $2,500.</p>

<p>The end o’ track did not pause here long. As soon
as switches and side-tracks enough had been laid the
rails hastened onward, for the Black Hills.</p>

<p>“We’ll ate our Christmas dinner atop, boys,” Pat
cheered. “An’ from yon, 8,000 feet in the air, we’ll
shake our fists at the Cintral haythen, over beyant
in Californy. ’Twill be better that, than shakin’ ’em
under each other’s noses here in this new roarin’ town
which is like to be the greediest yet after your money.”</p>

<p>The work grew harder. The winds of November
and December blew fiercely, sweeping the sand and
gravel and snow into the men’s faces; Crow Creek
froze, the water had to be hauled from holes chopped
through the ice, there were days when the laying had
to quit entirely, until the grade was scraped clear. And
the climb and curves and cuts would have slowed the
march even in summer.</p>

<p>General Dodge was back from his exploring trip into
the far west. He had taken his company through to
Salt Lake, and then east again by a northern route.
He had found no survey better than the Percy Browne
lines; the road was to run through the Red Basin.</p>

<p>“To Fort Sanders was the plan o’ him an’ Gin’ral
Casement,” said Pat. “Two hundred an’ eighty-eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
miles for the year, that is. But we’re like to fall short
o’ that an’ we’ll rist content when we’ve planted post
540 at the top o’ the grade. ’Twill be 500 miles o’
track laid in two seasons o’ twelve months altogether—near
sixty miles a month—two miles a workin’ day,
ain’t it, week in an’ week out? B’ gorry, I call that
purty good, meself, an’ the Cintral bunch o’ pig-tails
can put the figgers in their pipes an’ smoke ’em.”</p>

<p>Therefore at the close of December the track and
grading gangs knocked off for the winter, with end o’
track almost to the top, and only ten miles this side
of Sherman Summit.</p>

<p>The pay-car pulled in, to pay off the men. General
Dodge, General Casement, Superintendent Reed, and
other officials came, for the last inspection of the year.
While the men were gathering their tools, to board
their train and “leave the job,” Terry and George and
Pat rode horseback up the grade to the top, for a view.</p>

<p>Snow whitened the pass, changing the Black Hills
to white; a wind always blew, up here, and the air
was cutting cold. The curves of the roadbed hid the
boarding-train and end o’ track, behind, but farther
in the east, and below, might be seen Cheyenne, sprawling
on the drear plains, with the rails apparently spanning
the distance to it. Southwest seventy-five miles
there uplifted hoary Long’s Peak, the northernmost
sentinel of the Colorado Rockies; ’twas claimed that
on a clear day you could see even the celebrated Pike’s
Peak, the southernmost sentinel, 150 miles by air-line.
Northwest, about 100 miles, beckoned the great, lone
Elk Mountain, at the western end of the Laramie
Plains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>In that direction Pat gazed—they all gazed, with
watering eyes. Pat sighed.</p>

<p>“Sure,” he said, “’tis a weary march, yet, rail by
rail, twenty-eight feet by twenty-eight feet, across
them plains, an’ across the waterless desert, an’ across
the snow mountains, and down to Salt Lake, an’ on,
ever on, into the west, for twice the distance we’ve
come already. But we’ll make it, lads. Aye, we’ll
make it, if we finish on our hands an’ knees. I hear
tell there be folks back in the States who say that no
head of a daycent-size family will live to see the iron
horse crossin’ continent from the Atlantic to the
Paycific. They say he’ll die of old age, before. But
I, Paddy Miles, construction foreman o’ Casement
Brothers, a-layin’ the U. Pay. tracks, say that afore
the Irishmen on the right o’ way have grown whiskers,
the smart-alicks themselves’ll be ridin’ on passes (if
they can get ’em) from Chicago to ’Frisco widout
change o’ cars.” He turned his horse. “Come on
back now. We’ll winter in Cheyenne, an’ be ready to
start in fresh on the job by the time the wild geese are
flyin’, in the spring.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the U. P.!” uttered George. “But
what I want to know next is, what has the C. P. done?”</p>

<p>“Well, they ain’t been loafin’, b’ gorry,” Pat assured.
“They’ve been workin’, whilst hangin’ on by
their toes.”</p>

<p>And that was so. In 1866 the U. P. had laid 260
miles of track; the C. P. only thirty-eight. This year
the U. P.’s record was 240 miles—“an’ ivery mile a
fight,” as Pat said; the C. P. record was only forty-six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
miles—but such miles, according to the California
and Salt Lake newspapers!</p>

<p>It was a thrilling story. The Central Pacific people
had started in 7,000 feet up, at the top of the Sierra
Nevada Range. They had had to haul their rails and
other supplies over snowy grades of ninety and 100
feet to the mile—one grade was the limit of 116 feet
to the mile! It took two of the most powerful engines
yet built, to each construction-train; the snow was
fifteen feet deep on the level, and half of the graders
had to spend their time shoveling it off the roadbed.
The track could not get over the top, on account of the
grade, and the snow there twenty to 100 feet deep,
so it went through, by a tunnel a third of a mile long,
drilled into solid granite rock, and blasted out with
powder. Some of the charges blew 3,000 tons of rock
into fragments at one whack—and rocks weighing
over 200 pounds were sent flying over half a mile.
The powder expense for one month was $54,000.</p>

<p>The company could not wait to get their engines
and rails by ship around Cape Horn, so they were
ordering them by the railroad across the Isthmus of
Panama—a shortcut. The freight bill on one locomotive
was $8,100; and two of the giant engines had
cost the company, when delivered, $70,752!</p>

<p>Forty miles of snow-sheds, of heavy timber, were
necessary, so that the road should not be snowed under
completely. There was to be one snow-shed over
twenty miles long! There was a tremendous amount
of high trestles, as well as a tremendous amount of
chiseling and blasting to make a roadbed in the faces
of the precipices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>Twenty-five saw-mills were busy, turning out timbers
and ties. Ten thousand Chinamen had been engaged,
as graders and track-layers. They were paid $30 a
month—or a dollar a day, including Sundays—and
furnished their own meals. They worked so close and
with such system that in a space of 250 feet there
sometimes were thirty carts and 250 graders, all as
busy as bees. White men could not be depended upon;
the white laborers were always being tempted away, to
the gold and silver mines.</p>

<p>The Central Pacific Company had not waited to
finish the big tunnel, or shovel off the snow. They
had sent several thousand men on ahead, in wagons,
twenty miles over and down, to work where the snow
was lighter. They had loaded a locomotive, taken
apart, and forty miles of rails and bolts and spikes,
upon wagons, and sent them over, too.</p>

<p>So that while the tunnel was being drilled and
blasted, and the grading done beyond, the advance
gangs were building, also. On December 13 the tracks
had descended the mountain as far as the Nevada
line; were getting down into the foothills, and early
in the spring would be amidst the sage-brush of the
Nevada desert, with an open way to Salt Lake!</p>

<p>“Gee! We fellows’ll have to hustle,” George remarked,
after he and Terry had succeeded in reading
the tattered newspapers, passed around at Cheyenne.
“They’ve got 600 miles yet to go, but it’s level; we’ve
got 500 miles, and we’re just starting in on the
mountains.”</p>

<p>“That Nevada desert country is fierce, though. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
good water for miles and miles, and lots of loose sand
and soda and alkali. Injuns, too—the Diggers and
Snakes. Our engineers have been across it surveying.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be worse than our Red Desert,” retorted
George—who had been there, himself. “And we’ve
got the Wasatch Mountains, besides.”</p>

<p>“Just the samee, I’ll bet on the Irish. We’ll beat
the Chinks into Salt Lake, and we’ll meet ’em while
they’re still coming,” Terry answered hopefully.
“You watch our smoke, boy, as soon as spring opens.
The Northwestern Railway is into Council Bluffs
across from Omaha, you know; we don’t have to haul
our stuff by wagon and boat any more—we get the
rails quick, right off the cars. We’ve got plenty timber
close to the line, in the Black Hills, for ties, and the
tie-camps are cutting and sawing now. We’re graded
already clear ahead to Sanders on the other side of
the Black Hills, and the surveys are about finished
from here to Salt Lake. Do you know how many
miles those engineers have covered since April? Three
thousand, three hundred and ten! I reckon General
Dodge has everything mapped, and sees just what he’s
going to do.”</p>

<p>“They say the company’s plumb out of money. We
lost, at only $16,000 a mile across the plains. Had to
do too much hauling at long distance.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess the Central didn’t make much money,
at $48,000 a mile in those mountains; and look at the
freight bills they’ve been paying. Now we get our
$48,000 a mile, for easy grading; and after that, $32,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
a mile. The U. P.’ll raise enough to start on
again.”</p>

<p>And evidently this was to be the case. General
Dodge went to New York, for a company meeting.
After he had explained the route, and had shown the
maps of the surveys, the company told him to go ahead
as fast as he could.</p>

<p>It was a busy winter in Cheyenne. Supplies of rails
and spikes and bolts and other iron ammunition poured
in as rapidly as the trains could bring them. Tons
and tons—thousands of tons—were stacked in the
Casement Bros.’ warehouses. And out along the line
over the Black Hills, and down, and away into the
Laramie Plains huge piles of ties and culvert and
bridge timbers were being collected.</p>

<p>Cheyenne boomed. It had 3,000 buildings and 6,000
people; and what with the graders and track-layers
who wintered there, several of the business firms were
selling goods to the amount of $30,000 a month! The
Home Restaurant did a fine business, besides feeding
its “men folks.”</p>

<p>Early in the spring General Dodge called all the
chiefs of departments to meet him at Omaha, the U.
P. headquarters. At the close of the meeting the word
was spread:</p>

<p>The trail had been decided upon. There was no
good route through Salt Lake City, and around the
south end of the Great Salt Lake. Ogden, at the north
end of the lake, thirty-six miles north of Salt Lake
City, was to be the Utah terminal point. But the engineers
were to set out at once, snow or no snow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
mountains or no mountains, and run their stakes from
the Laramie Plains to Humboldt Wells over 200 miles
<i>west</i> of Ogden!</p>

<p>The graders were to start in as soon as the frost was
out of the ground so that they could dig.</p>

<p>The track-layers were expected to lay 500 miles of
track in eight months—and then keep going the 220
miles farther, so as to meet the C. P. at Humboldt
Wells in the next year, 1869!</p>

<p>“For th’ love o’ Hiven!” Pat Miles gasped, reading
the orders. “To Ogden, is it, 500 miles, t’other side
the snow range, at one jump—an’ 220 miles across the
desert, at another? Oh, well! Faith an’ we’ll do it.
The Cintral have their 10,000 Chinks, but the U. Pay.’ll
have 15,000 white men. That’s all we nade: men,
men, an’ more men—an’ a bit o’ money to pay ’em
wid.”</p>

<p>The additional men poured into Cheyenne, like the
iron was pouring in. They raised the population to
10,000. An army of picks and spades, sledges, ploughs
and scrapers only awaited the word: “Forward!”
The surveying parties had gone at once. From Omaha
the chiefs had passed through, picking up their squads
on their way. Some were camped on the Laramie
Plains; some were camped at Rawlins Springs of the
high plateau; some were into the Red Desert; some
were crossing the Wasatch Range of Utah with sleds,
over snow to the tops of the telegraph poles; some were
in the Nevada desert beyond the Salt Lake, and facing
the Central engineers. That was George’s father’s
job. He had not come in at all, but had wintered at
Salt Lake and Ogden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>It was to be the greatest race ever run on the American
continent. Every mile gained meant $48,000 or
$32,000; it meant also a grant of land twenty miles
deep on either side of the tracks; and it meant beating
the other fellow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>THE “TARRIERS” MAKE A RECORD</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hurrah!</span> Everybody come out to end o’ track
tomorrow. We’re going to throw a scare for sure
into those Central gangs.”</p>

<p>That was Terry, bursting in through the back doorway
of the Home Cooking restaurant, in this last new
base and division point, of Bryan, far western Wyoming.
Time: Friday evening, late in September, 1868.</p>

<p>“What kind of a ‘scare,’ Terry?”</p>

<p>“Track-laying. Another record. The Central
matched our six miles in a day by claiming seven.
General Casement is out yonder, with General Corse
and a bunch of other big-bugs, and they’re feeling
good; and tomorrow General Casement is going to
show us off and put a stopper in the Central’s brag.”</p>

<p>“How far away are you now, boy?” George asked.</p>

<p>“Eighteen miles. They’re setting mile-post 877,
at a side-station named Granger. We’ve just
crossed the line into Utah (for Utah had not yet lost
so much of its northeast corner) and that’s one reason
we celebrate. Pat says he’ll lay eight miles as a
mark for the ‘C. Pay. haythen’ to aim at.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it can be done,” Terry’s father
declared.</p>

<p>“Yes, it can. Sure it can. Look at what we’ve
been laying right along in the desert: two and three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
miles, and four, and once six, in mighty bad country.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there, Terry,” Virgie cried. “I want to
see.”</p>

<p>What a spring and summer that had been! And
what a fall and winter it was to be! The great race
was in full swing.</p>

<p>In middle April the U. P. track-layers had finally
broken loose from winter quarters in Cheyenne, and
since then they had not wasted a day.</p>

<p>At the start, the grade had not yet been clear of
snow, nor the ground thawed, and it took twenty-four
days to make thirty-three miles to the Laramie River
just below Fort Sanders across the Black Hills.</p>

<p>A third of Cheyenne flocked here, to the new base
named Laramie City. Even before the track got in,
Laramie City boasted the title “Gem City of the
Mountains,” had 500 shacks and 3,000 people, and
was “roaring.” The freight trains were close behind
end o’ track, and the passenger trains from Omaha
began to roll in again.</p>

<p>In rolled, on wheels, the Cheyenne take-down buildings
and the gambling and saloon and side-show outfits—and
among the very first of all the outfits to
report, was the Home Cooking restaurant. It had
proved so popular that, as George said, it was given
a “front seat.”</p>

<p>Terry and his father, at the farther front, were
glad indeed to welcome it. But the grading gangs
were on ahead, and the track-layer gang stayed only
long enough to lay the switches and sidings. Then
the rails leaped forward, on the trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“’Tis a long way yet to the ind o’ the 500 miles,
lads,” reminded Paddy; and with him urging, and
extra wages promised for Sundays and holidays, the
track-layers scarcely straightened their backs except
at darkness.</p>

<p>The track flew through the length of the Laramie
Plains and found a bridge ready at the North Platte
River almost on the very spot where young Engineer
Appleton had swung across with the news of Percy
Browne’s death. Leaping the river the rails paused
to plant another terminal and supply base just beyond
brand-new Fort Steele.</p>

<p>One hundred and twenty-six miles in sixty days.
That was doing better—— “But we’re a bit soft
still,” Pat apologized.</p>

<p>The supply base was named Benton. It proved to
be the “roaringest” town yet—a seething town of
red dust, of North Platte, Julesburg, Cheyenne and
Laramie gamblers and saloon keepers, and of night
turned into day. The river was three miles away, east,
and water for the town people had to be hauled by
wagons, price ten cents a bucket; but many of the
inhabitants cared little for water.</p>

<p>Benton grew in a twinkling to 5,000 citizens; take-down
business blocks were put together and set up in
a day; it was said that two boys with screw-drivers
could set up an imitation “brown-stone front” house
(which arrived all boxed and numbered), in three
hours. One gambler outfit ran the Big Tent—a
canvas building 100 feet long and forty feet wide, and
floored for dancing. But in three months Benton was
less than Julesburg; there was not even a station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>For the rails had again sprinted. They passed
right through the ravine of Rawlins Spring, dipped
down into the Red Desert at the place where George
and the rest of the Bates party had been rescued, and
following the Percy Browne survey they never stopped
for water or anything. The construction-train brought
the water from behind, in tanks, until wells were
drilled; wagons carried it forward to the grading
gangs. Much of the water was rank with alkali and
soda; it made the men ill, and foamed and encrusted
in the engine boilers; but the Red Desert had no terrors
for the U. P. gangs.</p>

<p>Long before, the reconnoitering surveyors, led by
the division chief, had picked out the landmarks of
hills and streams, as guides for the location surveyors.
The location surveyors pressed after, with their maps
and charts, to drive the stakes—at four, eight,
twelve miles a day. Eating the stakes, 100 miles at
a mouthful, the grading gangs, 8,000 and 10,000
strong, tried to keep fifty miles ahead of end o’ track.
In their rear, ten and twenty miles ahead of end o’
track, the bridge crews and culvert crews plied hammer
and saw. Behind them, and four or five miles
ahead of end o’ track, the tie-layers and ballasters
tugged and tamped. And end o’ track pursued with
500 other men and fifty teams.</p>

<p>In a perfect cloud the freight and supply wagons
toiled back and forth beside the grade. They formed
a line of alkali dust 150 miles long, stirred up by the
hoofs of 5,000 horses and mules. And east of end
o’ track were the puffing boarding-train and the busy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
construction-train, while Jimmie Muldoon and his little
brother dashed down and back, fetching the loads
of rails.</p>

<p>The Red Desert never had seen the like. In fact,
the whole United States was getting excited. Every
night the news was flashed by telegraph to New York:
“The Union Pacific today laid two (or three, or five)
miles of track,” and it was published in large headlines
across the first pages of the New York papers.</p>

<p>General Casement lived constantly at the front;
his brother Dan Casement worked day and night moving
the supplies out of the warehouses. General Dodge
made trip after trip from Omaha and by stage and
horse across the mountains, even clear to Humboldt
Wells of Nevada. Mr. Silas Seymour, the New York
consulting engineer, was out; so were Mr. Hoxie and
Mr. Snyder, who had charge of the operating of the
road, from Omaha. And in mid-summer there had
come a very distinguished party indeed, who inspected
from Fort Sanders to end o’ track.</p>

<p>These were General U. S. Grant, himself, the chief
of the Army; General Sherman, General Phil Sheridan,
half a dozen other famous ’way-up army officers, Mr.
Thomas C. Durant, of New York, the vice-president
of the Union Pacific company and the man who raised
the funds; and Mr. Sidney Dillon, again—the
chairman of the board of directors.</p>

<p>They rode in a special Pullman car, and the track-layer
gang eased up long enough to cheer them as
they tumbled out and gazed about.</p>

<p>The Lincoln car was being kept busy chasing the construction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
and accepting the track in sections of twenty
to forty miles at a time, for the Government.</p>

<p>End o’ track traveled too rapidly for it. Far westward,
in western Nevada the Central was putting in
its best licks, too. One day its track-gang laid five
miles of rails, and wired the news to New York, as
a record. Pat was told, and grunted; and that same
week the U. P. gang laid six miles in a day. The
Central heard, and retorted by laying seven miles at
one rush.</p>

<p>“An’ what o’ that?” growled Pat. “Sivin, you
say? Wait till we get our toes set in a likely place, an’
we’ll hand ’em eight, as sugar for their tay.”</p>

<p>In the middle of September another supply base had
been planted—Green River, 150 miles from Benton,
and 845 miles from Omaha.</p>

<p>Three hundred miles of track, counting sidings, laid
in five months of mainly “bad weather an’ worse
wather,” as Paddy said. Average, sixty miles a
month. The news was flashed to New York.</p>

<p>When the pay-car pulled in once more, Terry and
George celebrated again in the Home Cooking restaurant.
Pat himself was well pleased. So were General
Dodge and General Casement. That had been a
hard stint, in the desert, but the desert was conquered.</p>

<p>Only a thousand people gathered at Green River.
End o’ track was traveling too fast also for some of
the toughs who sought to make “roaring” towns—and
some of them had been killed on this westward
trail. But the Home Cooking restaurant bravely kept
up the march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>It was a great institution—this Home Cooking
restaurant. The two women were being called the
“Heroines of the U. P.” Everybody respected them,
and they still did a splendid business in good coffee
and pies and doughnuts—“like your mother used
to make.” But Terry and George hid the suspicion
that they stuck it out on purpose to make a home for
their men-folk.</p>

<p>George, because he was attached to the pay-car,
which had its headquarters in the terminals, drew the
big end of the bargain. He might eat and sleep “at
home” almost every night. His father, though, out
on survey, didn’t get in at all.</p>

<p>As for Terry, he and his father came in every night,
as long as they might, between terminals. Old 119 and
its crew—Engineer Richards and Fireman Sweeny—had
been transferred from the boarding-train to
the leading construction-train; and this was great,
because while they were within twenty miles of the
terminal they could scoot back, for supper and breakfast
and a visit.</p>

<p>Virgie was having the time of her life, riding up
and down track in the engine—bent upon being the
“first passenger across,” she insisted.</p>

<p>Green River did not last long. It was the best built
of any of the roaring towns; quite a number of its
buildings were adobe, or dried clay, put up to stay and
to be warm winter quarters; but the railroad decided
to locate its division point farther on, and staked out
another town, Bryan, fourteen miles.</p>

<p>The bridge over the Green River was waiting; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
Red Desert and the Bitter Creek Desert had been
crossed at last; the Wasatch Mountains ahead were
already whitened by the first snows; and presently
Green River town was left behind, deserted. Everybody—including
the Home Cooking restaurant—moved
on to Bryan, and Bryan “roared.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go to end o’ track tomorrow with you, Terry.
I want to see,” repeated Virgie.</p>

<p>“I’ll be there, as usual,” Terry’s father laughed,
grinning. “You can’t lose Virgie and me and 119.”</p>

<p>“It’s pay-day. So I’ll be there with the pay-car,
you can bet,” George asserted.</p>

<p>“Well, you want to start mighty early, then, or we’ll
be out of sight,” bragged Terry. “They’ll begin at
seven sharp and work right through to five-thirty with
only half an hour nooning. That’s ten hours. Can’t
you come, ma; you and Mrs. Stanton?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no! We’ve got people to feed.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can slip away once, between times,”
promised George’s mother.</p>

<p>“I can take you up, on one trip of the construction-train,”
Engineer Richards proposed. “By the way
they talk, they’ll keep me busy hauling iron. Eight
miles of track calls for something over 300 car-loads
of material, and they haven’t near enough iron on
their dumps.”</p>

<p>The day dawned fine and snappy. When at six
o’clock the construction-train pulled out with Terry
and Virgie in the cab, its cars were black with people
as well as rails and spikes and fastenings. A large
part of Bryan was bound to end o’ track, also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>Paddy Miles already was busy, marshalling his
gang on the outskirts of Granger siding. Little General
Casement, his overcoat collar turned up around
his whiskers, stood nervously puffing a cigar. His
party of guests were with him. The chief of them
was Major-General John M. Corse, an old army
friend. They all had been entertained by General
Casement—hunting and fishing and seeing the
country, and making the grading-camps their base.
They looked as though they’d had a gay night, celebrating
in advance; but no amount of work or fun
ever phazed the little general.</p>

<p>“Sure, is that your load—mainly peoples?”
Pat hailed, of the cab, as he ran down the line of flat-cars,
inspecting. “Get out the way, iv’ry wan o’ yez,
an’ stand clear, or we’ll be ’atin’ the iron from under
yez.”</p>

<p>The boarding-train stood upon the siding, to leave
the way open for the construction-train to back on up
in the wake of the trucks. The trucks were loaded
and waiting. Jimmie Muldoon, his face as red as his
hair, with excitement, sat his bony horse, expectant;
his brother (likewise red) sat old Jenny, the rope taut.
Old yellow Jenny had grown gaunt and stiff in the
service; many and many a mile after mile had she
galloped, but she was still game.</p>

<p>The long corrugated row of ties stretched westward,
waiting, too. The nearest graders were staring back
as they worked, to see the start. At the very end o’
track there was a dump of iron, in readiness. Every
little help counted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>General Casement had been looking at his watch.</p>

<p>“Go!” he barked.</p>

<p>“Lay to it, lads,” shouted Pat. “We’re off. Now
show them Cintral haythen a touch o’ the Irish!”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” the crowd cheered.</p>

<p>A file of the men attacked the end dump. Two by
two they seized the rails and hustled them forward, in
pairs. “Down! Down!” “Whang, whang, whangity-whang!”
The fish-plate squads sprang with bolts
and wrenches. In a few moments there were two
streams of the rail-carriers—one double line trotting
forward, one double line running back. End o’ track
fairly leaped ahead. The dump became a far carry,
when at a signal from Pat old Jenny and her truck-load
came charging, with one-legged Dennis riding
atop and Jimmie Muldoon’s brother whooping for
passage.</p>

<p>“Hooray!”</p>

<p>The truck was emptied rapidly, as it rolled on, yard
by yard, to keep up with the track. Now it was tipped
to one side, and on charged Jimmie himself bringing
fresh supply. Back galloped old Jenny.</p>

<p>General Casement was timing.</p>

<p>“Faster, men,” he rapped. “Down with ’em. Hit
’em hard. Be ready with those fish-plates, boys.
Make every move tell. We’re out for a record.”</p>

<p>The men who had been carrying the rails turned to
ballasting. So fast the track advanced that the crowd
of spectators were constantly jostling onward, advancing
also. George arrived, breathless, from the pay-car.
Superintendent Reed had come up with it; so had Dan
Casement, the general’s brother and partner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“How far’ve they gone now?” George panted, his
eyes snapping.</p>

<p>“I dunno. We’ve just started. But look at ’em
hustle, will yuh!” answered Terry.</p>

<p>Virgie danced impatiently, craning and cheering.</p>

<p>“I guess they’ll lay ten miles, won’t they?” she
implored.</p>

<p>“Aw, what’s the matter with you?” George rebuked.
“That’s just like a girl. No gang can lay
ten miles in a day.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pat’s gang can, though, maybe,” she retorted.</p>

<p>The men were sweating. Steam rose from their
bended forms. Old Jenny and the truck horse were
sweating, pushed at top speed back and forth. The
clang of the rails and the whang of the sledges never
faltered. End o’ track leaped westward, toward the
distant graders. The dumps were melting and disappearing.</p>

<p>“Look out! Here comes the train!”</p>

<p>At exactly the right moment old 119, with Terry’s
father and Fireman Bill Sweeny gazing rearward from
throttle and bell, pushed the construction-train on up
over the new track as far as it could. Its extra large
crew worked madly to throw the iron overboard into
more dumps, nearer at hand.</p>

<p>Out puffed the train, gathering speed, for another
load. Right on its heels Jimmie Muldoon tore with
his truck, to the farthest dump again. There was no
delay.</p>

<p>What with the constant pressing forward, all eyes
upon the rails as they were laid, it was hard to keep
posted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“How far’ve we gone now? How far’ve we gone
now?” appealed George, foolishly.</p>

<p>“How do I know? Gee whiz!” Terry rebuked.
“I forget where we started from. You ought to count
the truck-loads. It takes about ten to a mile,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I’ve lost count,” George complained.</p>

<p>“So’ve I,” confessed Terry. “Anyway, we’re sure
traveling. Granger’s getting out of sight.”</p>

<p>Time flew like the end o’ track. With shrill whistle
the construction-train backed in again, ready. It
scarcely seemed possible that the round trip had been
made so soon. The old dumps were vanishing; the
last was almost gone; on came the train, rear end first;
over went the iron, with a noisy clangor; and back
started sturdy 119, dragging her rumbling empties.</p>

<p>On her next trip she brought Terry’s mother and
George’s mother.</p>

<p>“Here come our folks,” George cried, spying them
as they hastened forward.</p>

<p>“How far?” they queried. That was the universal
question: “How far?”</p>

<p>“About three miles. We’re almost at the third mile-stake.
We’ll pass it in a minute or two.”</p>

<p>“Are you coming back to dinner when we go?”</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t noon yet, is it?”</p>

<p>“No, but it will be soon.”</p>

<p>“Aw, shucks!” Terry uttered. “We can’t leave
for dinner. Not this noon. We’ll eat here, with the
gang. We’ve got to be on the job. And so has
dad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“That’s what he says,” sighed his mother. “But
seems to me you can take time to eat at home.”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t do it in half an hour. Might be missing
something,” Terry explained. “There’ll be plenty
grub here.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stay,” Virgie declared. “I don’t want to miss
anything, either.”</p>

<p>The busy Pat had glimpsed them with the corner of
an eye.</p>

<p>“Work hard, boys,” he urged. “The Heroines o’
the U. Pay. are watchin’ yez. A fine big doughnut
to the crew that lays the last pair o’ rails in the eight
miles!”</p>

<p>The construction-train emptied. The two mothers
returned on it to Bryan. The three-mile stake had
been passed, and the four-mile stake was drawing
nearer. General Casement had been looking at his
watch. He was right at end of track, all the way on.</p>

<p>“Time!” he barked.</p>

<p>“Toime, men,” echoed Pat.</p>

<p>They instantly quit work and straightened up
wearily. The general tucked his watch into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Three and three-quarter miles, and we’ll better
that this afternoon,” he said, to his party. “I’ll win
my thousand dollars, gentlemen. We’ll finish out our
eight miles, and I’ve another thousand to say so.”</p>

<p>“Golly!” George blurted. “He’s bet a thousand
dollars on it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon he’ll win, all right,” answered
Terry. “The gang’s just getting limbered up. Come
on, you and Virgie. Let’s hunt grub.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>The cooks had coffee and meat and potato and hot-bread
ready. The squads were flocking to their messes.</p>

<p>“We’ll eat with Pat,” Terry proposed; and so they
did, Virgie having the seat of honor.</p>

<p>“We’ll make it, we’ll make it,” Pat assured. “Sure
we’ll make it. Ain’t we got to stick up a mark for
them Chinks to aim at? Yes, an’ ain’t the papers out
east waitin’ wid their big type, to tell all the world
about it? Aye, we’ll make it. An’ if I know the
gin’ral, then that thousand dollars’ll go as ’asy as it
comes to him, an’ iv’ry man’ll have a bit to cilibrate
on.”</p>

<p>Twelve-thirty! “Time!”</p>

<p>“Hit ’em ag’in, lads!” yelped Pat.</p>

<p>“Down! Down!” “Whang! Whang! Whangity-whang!”</p>

<p>A portion of the crowd had gone back to Bryan for
dinner. Number 119 brought them in again, with the
iron. Back and forth plied gaunt old Jenny and the
bony nag her partner, hauling the trucks. Back and
forth, on haul ever longer, plied the construction-train.
End o’ track, followed by the General Casement party
and the crowd, ever shot onward.</p>

<p>Mile-stake Four was passed; and in record time,
Mile-stake Five; and Stake Six; and when the sun was
low over the crests of the Wasatch Range, Stake
Seven!</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Seven miles! Nobody’ll beat that, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Wan more, now!” rasped Pat, hoarse with bossing
at top speed. “Wan more, an’ yez can stop an’ have
the rist o’ the day off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“You’ve got the time, but no time to spare,” snapped
General Casement. He was getting nervous.</p>

<p>“Aw, they’ll make it,” said Terry, to George and
Virgie. “But I’m sort of tired, myself. We’ll have
stood around for eight miles, by night. How you
feeling, Virgie?”</p>

<p>“I’m all right.”</p>

<p>“It’s toughest on Jenny. Look at her. She’s about
all in,” spoke George.</p>

<p>That was the truth. Old Jenny’s yellow hide was
dark and dirty and dank with sweat. Her nostrils
flared, her ribs heaved, her eyes were wide and bulging,
her breath sounded wheezily, and as she toiled down
and up again, kicked vigorously by Jimmie Muldoon’s
brother, she frequently stumbled.</p>

<p>“Her legs are giving out,” Terry pronounced.
“Poor old Jenny. She’s come a long way.”</p>

<p>“Guess <i>so</i>,” George agreed. “They ought to let
her quit, after today, and put her on a pension.”</p>

<p>The eight-mile stake was in sight; the men were on
their last spurt. The sun had set behind the Wasatch.
That made no difference. The sun set early, these
days, here.</p>

<p>“Down! Down!” “Whang! Whang! Whangity-whang!”
The brisk chorus never ceased; the men
never faltered. Some of them, too, staggered and
stumbled, but they didn’t miss a step or a blow. They
all were wringing wet. Several had lost their hats—they
didn’t pause to pick them up.</p>

<p>“Wonder what time it is now,” George remarked.</p>

<p>“I dunno. Must be five o’clock; feels that way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“This is a mighty long mile!”</p>

<p>“Sure is. It’s going to be a close shave.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess they’ll make it, all right,” said
George, hopefully.</p>

<p>“Will, if Jenny holds out.”</p>

<p>Jenny was standing straddled and trembly, her long
ears lax and her head hanging. Her rider scarcely
could budge her, between hauls. But the truck was
empty, her rope had been hooked on to the rear end,
the truck was tipped aside to let Jimmie Muldoon by,
it was tipped back upon the track, her rider kicked her
in the ribs, and she groaned and started.</p>

<p>“Give that boy a pair of spurs, somebody,” called a
voice from the crowd. Jenny broke from her shamble
into a gallop, and went laboring down track. Jimmie
Muldoon’s nag stood heaving—near spent, himself.</p>

<p>The men snatched the rails off. Working fast—“Down!
Down!”—they bared the truck and end o’
track reached out, for the eight-mile stake.</p>

<p>“Tip her! Tip her!” For the truck was empty
and Jenny’s truck was nearing.</p>

<p>“Come on! Hurry up!” And Pat frantically
waved his arm.</p>

<p>“What ails ye?” he bawled. “Put your heels into
her ribs.”</p>

<p>“Bite her ear, boy!” That was mean advice.</p>

<p>Old Jenny tried to respond, as the crowd yelled and
her rider pummeled her with hands and feet. She
galloped again—but no use. Suddenly she swayed
aside, blindly; and down she pitched, all in a heap;
struggled an instant, to rise; rolled over and lay stiffening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
right across the track. Jimmie Muldoon’s
brother rolled also, but he got up.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Virgie, covering her eyes with her
hands. “Jenny’s dead. I know she’s dead.”</p>

<p>“Come on!” exclaimed Terry. He ran; George
ran; Pat ran; the crowd flocked, whooping and
laughing.</p>

<p>“T’row her off’n the track. For the love o’ the
saints, t’row her off,” panted Pat. “She’s blockin’
traffic.”</p>

<p>A dozen men toiled, grabbing her by the legs and
head and turning her over.</p>

<p>“Iron! Where’s the iron!” That was the call
from end o’ track.</p>

<p>Now the rope had been unhooked and with one-legged
Dennis putting his shoulder to the load, a dozen
men swarmed against the truck and began to roll it
forward.</p>

<p>“Whoa’p! That won’t do.” General Corse had
laughingly objected. “You’re getting outside help.
Casement. It isn’t in the bargain.”</p>

<p>“Let the truck alone. Bring on another animal—horse
or mule, but bring it on,” stormed General Casement,
watch in hand. “Quick, now.”</p>

<p>Pat yelled and waved and danced. People worked
fast, but it seemed another long time before a white
horse had taken Jenny’s place; and leaving her wet,
muddy body lying, the truck rumbled on.</p>

<p>Virgie was still standing in place, her fingers pressing
her eyes tight shut.</p>

<p>“Is Jenny dead?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“I’m afraid she is, Virgie,” answered Terry.</p>

<p>“Then I want to go home,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>But what was that? General Casement had
shouted—“Time!” the men had thrown down their
tools, and were waiting and gazing and mopping their
faces. The truck had not been a quarter emptied,
and the stake was still on ahead.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t have made it, anyway, mule or no
mule,” announced the general, calmly. “But we did
our best. It’s a record to be proud of. The Central
will know we’re on the job, at this end.”</p>

<p>“They’re quitting!” George gasped.</p>

<p>“How far do you want to call it, general?” asked
General Corse.</p>

<p>“Seven miles and five-eighths, sir. That won’t miss
it more than a foot. And I also call it a mighty good
day’s work. Come on. Let’s go to supper.” With
that, General “Jack,” champion track-layer of the
continent, turned on his heel and strode off. He
didn’t seem to care anything about the thousand dollars,
or about Jenny.</p>

<p>“Close onto eight, annyhow,” Pat puffed. “’Twill
be somethin’ for them pig-tails to chaw on.”</p>

<p>The tired men gave a cheer, and looking for coats
and hats surged to meet the boarding-train or else to
their camps. The crowd raced for the construction-train,
and a ride back to Bryan. Helping the weeping
Virgie, Terry and George hastened for the cab of 119.
They passed Jenny—or what had been Jenny. She
was dead; she didn’t give a sign of knowing who they
were, although her eyes were staring wide open.</p>

<p>“Don’t suppose there’s any use in trying to bury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
her,” George proposed, as they paused a moment, while
Virgie ran on blubbering.</p>

<p>“Nope. Who’d lend a hand at it? What does
the U. P. care about a horse or mule?” Terry demanded,
thickly.</p>

<p>“She died in line of duty, just the same; like old
Shep was killed in action.”</p>

<p>“I know it. But that’s happening to something or
somebody, about every day; and doesn’t matter, as long
as the rails move forward.”</p>

<p>Remembering the handcar crew and the freight-train
crew, and Percy Browne and Surveyor Hills
(who was younger still), and now counting Shep and
Jenny, it did seem as though the road was taking a
heavy toll. There were many others, besides—somebody
or something almost every day, as Terry had
said.</p>

<p>Each bestowing upon Jenny’s cold hide a last pat,
they followed after Virgie.</p>

<p>“Reckon we’ll have to break the news to Harry,
back at Laramie,” remarked George. Harry Revere
had got as far as Laramie City, and was lightning-shooter
there, now.</p>

<p>“Yes, reckon we will,” Terry mused. “I’m glad
he wasn’t here to see. He’s powerful fond of old
Jenny.”</p>

<p>Somehow, they all felt rather sober, that night in
the cosy Home Cooking restaurant. But it had been
a great day. Seven and five-eighths miles of track in
the ten hours. Whew! And Jenny had not been to
blame. General Casement was satisfied. He had said
that they wouldn’t have made the eight miles, anyway.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>A FIGHT FOR A FINISH</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Whew!</span> Watch those tarriers ‘drill,’ will you!”</p>

<p>The fall of 1868 had vanished in a whirlpool of
furious work. Now in the early winter Terry Richards
stood beside George Stanton, at the entrance to
a cut through snow higher than their heads, high up
towards the crest of the Wasatch Mountains dividing
Wyoming from Utah, and with frosty breath exclaimed
while the rails went forward.</p>

<p>Truly an inspiring sight this was. The landscape
was white. For a day there had been a thawing wind,
which melted the snow of the partially cleared grade,
had left the grade and ties icy, and turned the rails to
twin lines which glittered under the sun of the succeeding
cold spell.</p>

<p>Far below stretched the row of men, working in
their shirt sleeves, with their breaths and the steam
from their bodies floating in vapor. The rails, brittle
from the frost, and handled carefully with mittens,
were clanging, the rail-trucks, hauled by the white-encrusted
Muldoon nags, rumbled from behind, and
the boarding-train, also white-coated, had pulled in, to
await the arrival of the construction-train.</p>

<p>Drowning the ring of sledges and clink of shovels
and crow-bars, from the west distance there occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
echoed the dull boom of blasts; for the grading
gangs were not so far ahead, now; the rails were on
their heels; the ground had frozen too hard for pick
and plough, and every yard of earth in the cuts had to
be blasted like granite. Three dollars a yard the U. P.
company were paying, the same as for rock work.</p>

<p>George had come up, on the pay-car, again. The
pay-car was halted just at the rear of the boarding-train.
Down the track, but out of sight, the construction-train
might be heard puffing noisily.</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon the C. P. folks met up with much
worse than this, in their mountains,” Terry added.</p>

<p>“Shucks, boy! Haven’t you heard tell that their
Chinks had to shovel a grade through forty feet
of snow pack?” scoffed George. “Yes, and build
wooden tunnels, like, to keep from being buried alive.
If they were good for forty feet, we’re good for sixty.
We aren’t going to stop for winter, either. We’re
bound on through, straight to Humbolt Wells.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” That was sudden news.</p>

<p>“I heard it on the way up. General Dodge and
Superintendent Reed were talking about it in the pay-car.
That’s what they’re talking about with General
Casement now, I bet. The track-gang and grading
gangs are going to work right on all winter, same
as any time. General Dodge said it would cost the
company $10,000,000 extra—but he’s had orders
from New York to keep going regardless, and meet
the C. P. at Humboldt Wells. So we’ve got to finish
those 725 miles at one stint, boy, while the C. P. are
building only 300. Think of that! They’ve been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
building all the year and we’ve still got 400, ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” Terry gasped. “And we’re in the
mountains, to boot, with the snow piling on top of us!
Wonder what Pat will say?”</p>

<p>General Dodge, General Casement and Superintendent
of Construction Reed were walking slowly
up track. The puffing of the construction-train
sounded more and more labored—now and then broke
into a terrific staccato or drum-fire as the drive-wheels
of its two engines slipped on the rails. It had a heavy
load of rails and ties both, an engine to pull and an
engine to push.</p>

<p>The three men turned to watch it come. It was
now in sight, rounding a curve below, weaving among
the pines and rocks, and coughing black smoke. It
entered a deep cut—emerged, and swaying and struggling
struck a long fill where the dirt ballast bridged a
hill slope, in a curve, and fell sharply away from under
the outer ends of the ties.</p>

<p>“Puff! Puff! Puff-puff-puff! <i>Puff! Puff!</i>
PUFF-puff-puff-puff-puff!”</p>

<p>The whole bank glistened with the ice; trickles from
the lately melted snow seamed it; it was a south slope,
and the ice and snow had melted a little today, again.</p>

<p>“She’ll never make it, will she?” George uttered.</p>

<p>“With dad and Bill running 119? Sure she’ll make
it,” declared Terry. “Dad says give old 119 sand
enough and she’ll climb a telegraph pole.”</p>

<p>Around the hill roared the heavy train, clouding all
the snowy timber with its dense smoke and shaking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
air with its bombardment of explosions. It gathered
way as it straightened out, for a moment; suddenly
began to tilt sideways—engine, tender, first car, second
car—the whistle spurted steam, but before the
shrieks of the engine and the shouts of the spectators
mingled, the track had yielded. Yes, the train, engine
and all, car chasing car in a tumbling, plunging hurly-burly
while the brakemen sprawled clear, was rolling
and sliding down the hill slope, taking rails and ties
with it. Its trail left a wide scar in the snow. Only
the pusher engine and the caboose remained, above.</p>

<p>General Dodge, General Casement and Superintendent
Reed already were running. Terry and
George ran. Amid wild shouts the track-gang, some
dropping their tools, others carrying crow-bars and
picks and spades, ran, slipping and staggering as they
pelted down the track, or by a shortcut forged through
the deep snow.</p>

<p>“Oh, gosh!” George panted, sprinting.</p>

<p>“I should say!” gasped Terry.</p>

<p>Marvelous to tell, the engine—good old No. 119!—had
landed right side up! Engineer Richards and
Foreman Bill had stuck to their posts; they were
dazedly descending from the cab.</p>

<p>“I’ve always said she was a lucky girl,” announced
Terry’s father, through the blood from a gash in his
cheek.</p>

<p>But what a mess that was, here in the little gulch!
A mixture of rails, ties, cars, extending from roadbed
to bottom. But nobody badly hurt.</p>

<p>“A foine dump yez made,” Pat wheezed, arriving.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
“Aren’t yez satisfied to lave the track where we laid
it? Move your feet, men,” he barked, at the staring,
laughing track-gang, tearing in out of breath. “Part
o’ yez on the grade ag’in; there’s rails an’ ties a-plenty,
an’ I want a new track widin the hour. What’s wan
train in the ditch, annyhow?”</p>

<p>All was good nature. The men sprang to their
tasks. General Casement nodded approvingly. He
and General Dodge beckoned Pat aside. Pat listened
and nodded also.</p>

<p>“Sure,” he agreed. “What’s the use o’ stoppin’ for
weather? Give us the rails an’ the pay-car reg’lar, an’
the boys’ll keep goin’.”</p>

<p>So the work was to continue all winter!</p>

<p>The many hands made a short job of laying a new
section of track. The engine with the pay-car backed
down; and aiding the derrick, it and the pusher engine
of the construction-train began to remove the wreck
from the ditch.</p>

<p>The U. P. gangs knew no such words as “quit.”
Their eyes were ever turned westward, peering for
Ogden and for the smoke of the C. P. construction-trains,
beyond.</p>

<p>“Wan hundred miles to the top, an’ wan hundred
down, on the last leg, an’ there we are, boys,” Pat had
cheered. He was a host in himself.</p>

<p>The Wasatch Range of the Rockies had loomed
ever nearer and nearer. It had proved to be a fine
hunting and fishing country; but nobody took the time
to hunt or fish. It had proved to be a wonderful
scenery country; but nobody had time to view the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
strange rocks and dashing rivers and pine-clad slopes.
The men only worked, ate, slept—and worked again,
to the tune of “Down! Down!” and “Whang!
Whang! Whangity-whang! Whang! Whang!” From
grading-camps and tie-camps, located far out in the
high timbered regions, wild nights and strenuous days
were reported.</p>

<p>The surveyors had found a pass better than the stage
road pass, over the north end of the Wasatch; the
advance grading gangs were being flung forward 150
miles, to blast the cuts and level the ridges; and
although Omaha was 900 miles behind, the rails were
coming forward in a long thunderous procession of
trains and dumped at the eager front.</p>

<p>“No hand shall be taken from the throttle until we
know that the front is supplied,” had telegraphed
Superintendent Hoxie, from Omaha.</p>

<p>And Terry as time-checker and George as pay-car
clerk were as busy as the busiest.</p>

<p>Up for the pass had climbed the track, following the
winding line of survey stakes that frequently stretched
one mile into two and three. End o’ track was eleven
miles north of old Fort Bridger, Jim Bridger’s station
on the Overland Stage trail, and 6,550 feet in air, when
winter struck.</p>

<p>On that October morning Terry, the track-layers
and ballasters had romped out from the boarding-train
into a foot of snow and an air thick with the
whirling flakes.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas!”</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ snow-birds we are!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Yes, an’ snow-shoes we’ll nade, for this kind o’
work.”</p>

<p>The men were lively, but the march was slowed. For
two days the storm had raged, before the weather settled
to clear and stinging cold. The construction-train,
No. 119 switched to the pulling end, bucked the drifts
with two engines; and as many men wielding shovels,
scraping the grade, as wielded sledges and picks and
crow-bars. There was plenty of wood, so that the
boarding-train and camps were kept warm.</p>

<p>Terry rode his horse breast-high in the white mantle,
to get the time from the gang bosses.</p>

<p>Storm had succeeded storm. It was to be a hard
winter and an early winter; and of the 500 miles only
some 375 had been finished. Now fairly out of their
mountains and into the Nevada desert, the C. P. crews
were coming fast—they had to haul fuel and ties and
water as well as their rails, from far behind, but they
had laid 250 miles and graded 300.</p>

<p>“They’ve got 350 miles yet to go, ’fore they reach
Ogden, ag’in our 100,” quoth Pat. “But if we’re
snowed in atop these mountains wid the passes behind
an’ ahid blocked, whilst they have only a few ridges to
cross, faith they’re like to bate us in the spring.”</p>

<p>Mile by mile, at snail’s pace instead of giant’s strides,
the U. P. track crept onward and upward, piercing the
snow.</p>

<p>“Well, if we can’t foller the stakes we can foller
the tiligraph poles,” Pat encouraged. “They’re
stickin’ into sight.”</p>

<p>For the railroad trail was now almost the same as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
Overland Stage trail, and the telegraph had been in
here since ’61.</p>

<p>All in all, readily enough might Terry Richards exclaim:
“Whew!” and wonder if the C. P. had had
any worse country in their winter mountains.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving caught them on the summit of the
pass over—7,500 feet up, but not so high as Sherman
Summit of the Black Hills.</p>

<p>“Down grade, hooray!” the men cheered, although
down grade made little difference. But they were getting
west of the Rockies, at last.</p>

<p>Before Christmas another town and supply base
awaited end o’ track. This was Evanston, named for
Mr. James Evans the engineering chief, in the Bear
River Valley on the west slope of the Uintah Range
of the Wasatch. ’Twas a depot for the ties that had
been floated down the Bear, and according to Geologist
Van Lennep there were coal-fields near by.</p>

<p>Omaha, 955 miles; Ogden, seventy-five miles. Of
the 955 miles the Government inspectors had accepted
940, already. From Bryan arrived Casement Brothers’
take-down warehouse, and the Home Cooking restaurant
bringing Mother Richards and Mother Stanton
and Virgie—but that was about all. The gamblers
and saloon-men and toughs had gathered from Utah
and the grading and tie camps.</p>

<p>Virgie was tickled to be at the front again. Now
she might ride the engine of the construction-train,
when she felt like it, and keep up her record of “first
passenger across.”</p>

<p>“Sure, ’tis a winter quarters for them that nade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
such,” announced Pat—and genuine winter quarters
Evanston certainly appeared to be, with the snow above
the roofs of the one-story shacks. “But we’ll not
stay long, oursilves; not even for Christmas cilibration
of more’n a day. We’ll put Wyoming behind
us, lad, an’ get into Utah wance more afore the year
closes. Yis, we’ll chase that boundary till we ketch
it.”</p>

<p>In the past few months Wyoming had passed end o’
track. It had taken a bite out of Utah’s northeast
corner; and this had been discouraging. But now end
o’ track forged on, out of Evanston into which the
passengers and freight already were rolling. In the
dusk of New Year’s Eve the track gangs threw down
their tools with a whoop.</p>

<p>Record for 1868, 425 miles: fifty miles a month, all
told, across the waterless desert and the frozen snowy
mountains, into Utah again, at last!</p>

<p>“An’ whereabouts is the C. Pay., then? How far
have they come, tell me?”</p>

<p>That was the great question. The telegraph ticked
the answer into Evanston.</p>

<p>“Track completed by the Central Pacific, in 1868:
363 miles.”</p>

<p>Pat groaned.</p>

<p>“They’re short o’ Humboldt Wells only forty odd
miles.” And he braced up. “But they’re short o’
Ogden some 270, ag’in our sivinty-five. An’ the orders
be to reach Ogden an’ kape’ goin’. We’ll make a
frish start ’arly wid this new year.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the United States awakened to the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
that the Salt Lake was to be reached not in 1870 but
in 1869, and that the iron highway across continent
was to be ready for business six years ahead of
schedule. The Government had required only fifty
miles a year; the two companies were building 200,
300, 400. The newspapers of East and West flared
with headlines.</p>

<p>“But where’ll we meet?” proposed George.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” Terry confessed. “If the C. P. keeps
coming one way, past Humboldt Wells, and we keep
going the other way, to Humboldt Wells, we won’t
meet anywhere.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>FAST TIME DOWN ECHO CANYON</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">All</span> aboard, now! On wid yez. We’ve no time
to lose, on the U. Pay.”</p>

<p>It was the voice of Paddy Miles, construction boss,
and also the present “conductor” of the construction-train
about to answer a hurry call sent up to Wasatch
station from end o’ track, for ties and iron.</p>

<p>Wasatch station, at mile-post 966, had marked end
o’ track on New Year’s Day, this 1869. It was eleven
miles from Evanston, the supply base, and seven miles
on from the sign-board which on the east side said
“Wyoming” and on the west side said “Utah.”</p>

<p>But since New Year’s end o’ track had advanced to
Echo City, twenty-five miles down Echo Canyon, and
was still going, although slowly.</p>

<p>That had been a tough job, to get onward from
Evanston. First, the sidings at Evanston were laid, in
the deep snow; and just beyond Wasatch, in order to
enter the pass of Echo Canyon, two trestles, one 230
feet long and thirty feet high, the other 450 feet long
and seventy-five feet high, had to be built, to cross side
gulches, and a tunnel 770 feet long—the longest tunnel
on the line—had to be bored through sandstone,
and frozen clay even harder.</p>

<p>When he learned that the railroad was not to touch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
Salt Lake City, President Brigham Young of the Mormons
had refused to lend any help; but Superintendent
of Construction Sam Reed had argued with him, in
friendly fashion, and had proved to him that Ogden
was the best point.</p>

<p>So President Young had fallen in again, had sent
men and teams and supplies, and with Mr. Reed himself
overseeing matters on that division the work
was being pushed.</p>

<p>“An’ sure, ain’t we got to hustle?” appealed Pat.
“For I hear tell that those yaller spalpeens on the C.
Pay.’ve jumped ahead o’ their own gradin’ by a matter
of a hundred miles an’ are startin’ in on a new division
entoirely, so’s to get into Ogden first.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But Mr. Reed has sent some of our own
graders 150 miles out, to grade into Humboldt Wells
while the C. P. are trying to grade into Ogden,”
laughed Terry.</p>

<p>“It’s a game two can play,” Pat admitted. “An’
there’ll be another game if those Chinks get in our
way, wance.”</p>

<p>The trestles were still being put in and the long
tunnel blasted. To pass around, a temporary road
had been laid, in a sort of zigzag—and “Z” it had
been named—or series of switchbacks, down from
the ridge that divided Wasatch, in the Bear River
Valley, and Echo Canyon. That had been quite a
job, too; the descent was very sharp—in fact, nearly
all the way to Ogden there was a sharp descent,
through several canyons, where the roadbed clung
to the canyons’ sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>This day Terry was up at Wasatch, on business;
George was going back with him—likewise on business
at end o’ track; and Paddy Miles had the construction-train
and its ’special hurry load.</p>

<p>“All aboard, now! On wid yez.”</p>

<p>There were sixteen flat-cars, and No. 119. A ride
through Echo Canyon was a treat. The narrow canyon
curved every which-way, was plumb full of oddly
shaped figures like Hanging Rock, Sentinel Rock,
Kettle Rocks, Pulpit Rock, The Great Eastern (which
resembled a steamboat), and so forth—all curious to
the graders and track-layers. And some of the downward
pitches were ninety feet to the mile, so that the
train swooped along without throttle and with brake-shoes
grinding.</p>

<p>To sit on a pile of ties and watch the scenery spin
past—that was a privilege for only employes of the
U. P. Passengers of the road had no such lark.</p>

<p>The two boys settled themselves comfortably, with
their legs hanging over the front end of the pile of
ties on the first tie car back from the engine, so as to
get a good view ahead. Paddy sat only a short distance
behind. There was a brakeman farther along,
and on one of the rear cars were a couple of Dutchmen—new
hands going forward to one of the grading
gangs.</p>

<p>Down the “Z” plunged the train (old No. 119
carefully holding back) for the first eight miles, and
struck into Echo Canyon at last at the Castle Rock.
The day was fine—sunny and not cold, although
snow lay on the north slopes and in the shaded hollows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
and the tips of the pines had scarcely commenced
to green out. But spring was in the air, for spring
came earlier to the west slope of the Rockies than to
the east slope.</p>

<p>The train began to roar between the rocky walls;
the engine, running almost free, whisked to right, to
left with the line of heavy cars whisked after; Fireman
Bill repeatedly jerked the whistle cord, and the
wails jangled from wall to wall and crag to crag.</p>

<p>It was a glorious ride—a charge by the U. P.
construction force, bringing reinforcements to the
front. The boys’ hats flared back, the breeze freshly
smote their faces, and every minute a new landmark
in shape of pinnacle and sculpture appeared, for an
instant, flashed by and was succeeded by another.
Hurrah!</p>

<p>“Great, eh?” gasped George.</p>

<p>“Sure beats staging. Look at the old stage road,
yonder. ’Twould take the stage four hours to make
this, and we’ll do it in one.”</p>

<p>“We’re the people, all right,” bragged George.
And he burst into song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Oh, it’s work all day</div>
<div class="verse">On the old U. Pay.,</div>
<div class="verse">And keep a-goin’ to Frisco Bay!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Terry interrupted:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter. Gee whiz! Look behind!
We’re busted!”</p>

<p>The engine also had interrupted with hoarse shriek
after shriek; Paddy was standing upright, waving his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
arms; the brakeman was running back—and a quarter
of a mile behind, up the grade, was the tail of the
trains: four cars, two loaded with ties, one with rails
and one with fastenings. The train, as Terry had expressed,
had “busted.”</p>

<p>“That’s a joke on the Dutchmen,” George cheered.
“What we going to do? Run on and leave ’em?”</p>

<p>“Maybe. Yes. No. I dunno! Jiminy, look at
’em come, though! Hope they don’t ram us.”</p>

<p>“Your father’s whistling for brakes. Hear
him?”</p>

<p>“That’s not to us; it’s to them.”</p>

<p>Terry and George sat straight, in alarm. The train
had reached a short level spot, but the four cars behind
were on a steep down grade and fairly leaping in
pursuit. The gap rapidly closed, until, still shrieking
for “Brakes,” and again for “Clear track,” old
119 sprang forward under open throttle, like a frightened
horse under the spur.</p>

<p>Around a curve swept the train; the four cars disappeared,
a moment—but here they came, full tilt,
their outside wheels almost leaving the rails as they
fought the tangent. Their speed had scarcely slackened.
Now the train struck into a long down grade;
the whistle, like the throttle, was open—but no use.
Those four heavy cars roared after, unchecked, and
with every yard their pace seemed to increase.</p>

<p>Engineer Richards was giving Number 119 all the
steam that he dared, if he would keep the track. The
boys’ car bounded and jerked; the pile of ties quivered;
rails jingled; the whole train roared, and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
canyon was filled with clamor of wheels and whistle.</p>

<p>The anxious, grimy face of Terry’s father or Fireman
Bill might be seen, peering backward from the
cab windows, trying to measure the margin of safety,
behind.</p>

<p>“What ails those Dutchmen, d’ you suppose?”
shouted George, in Terry’s ear. “’Fraid to put on
their brakes. That’s all they need do: put on their
brakes.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. Put on their brakes. Why don’t
they put on their brakes?” Terry yelled back. “Do
they want to smash us?”</p>

<p>The four cars were gaining; down they came, like a
thunderbolt, and not a sign of their two passengers
was visible.</p>

<p>Terry half stood, the better to see—yes, and the
quicker to jump clear, if necessary; George tried to
imitate him, but the train hit another curve and they
both were thrown to hands and knees and barely escaped
going overboard before time.</p>

<p>Around this curve also roared the train, throttle
opened wider for the more level stretch, whistle still
shrieking wildly; the four cars chased hotly—across
a trestle the train boomed, and the rumble of the four
cars answered instantly.</p>

<p>Old 119 was now barely holding her own, and there
were steep grades ahead. Never had a train gone
down this canyon at such a rate; and those four cars
acted like a hungry dragon bent upon getting a meal.</p>

<p>Pat and the brakeman were clutching to the ties of
the rear car of the train, pitching and swaying as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
they gazed and waved and gesticulated, warning the
four cars to keep distance.</p>

<p>“What they doing? Look! What they doing?”
yelled George, on a sudden.</p>

<p>“They’re dumping off the ties! Come on. We
got to help.”</p>

<p>That was a difficult journey, to rear of train. The
curves were incessant, shooting the train to right and
left, and throwing the passengers with it. Crawl,
hang hard, take a run, and crawl and hang hard again,
was the only way to navigate.</p>

<p>Pat did not pause; neither did the brakeman. They
already had cleared one tier of ties from their car.</p>

<p>“Lend a hand here. Pass those ties along,” they
only yelped, over their shoulders.</p>

<p>“But you’ll kill those Dutchmen,” screamed Terry.</p>

<p>“No. They’ve jumped, long ago.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Paddy added, “either they lave the track
or we do; an’ if they smash into us wance, then we’ll
all be gone together.”</p>

<p>This was the plan: to plant a tie on the track, and
derail the four cars. But although everybody worked
furiously, heaving the ties over the end of the car, the
ties bounded like Indian rubber—seemed scarcely to
touch the track before they went hurtling and flying
far to one side or the other.</p>

<p>“B’ gorry!” Pat gasped, streaming sweat. And—“If
we only can get into Echo City wid time enough
for ’em to shunt wan or the other of us into a
sidin’——!”</p>

<p>Echo City, at the end of the canyon! There were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
the sidings. Now the gap narrowed again, the four
cars cared nothing for the ties with which they were
being bombarded, but the whistle of 119 was changed
to the signal “Open switches!”</p>

<p>Would the crews at Echo City understand? Would
they have time to work right? Hauling and tugging
and dragging, Terry and George had farther and
farther to pass the ties back to the outstretched hands
of Paddy and the brakeman. It certainly was a mad
ride, this—a ride for life, too! Blame those four
cars—and blame those two Dutchmen, who ought to
have stayed aboard and set their brakes!</p>

<p>“Will we make it, yuh think?” wheezed George, as
he labored.</p>

<p>“Close squeeze,” wheezed Terry. “How far,
wonder?”</p>

<p>“Dunno. Can’t read mile-posts. Must be near,
though.”</p>

<p>Around still another of those dangerous curves—and
they roared past a little group of graders, repairing
the track. They had just a fleeting glimpse of the
staring, startled faces and the red-shirted forms; and
with the four cars thundering after they dashed on.</p>

<p>But Echo City was not far. Then, if the station
crews failed to work mighty fast, there would be a
race clear to end o’ track—and, whew!</p>

<p>“Look! Oh, gee!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_214">

</figure>

<p>George had yelped excited, and awed. Terry
looked. He was only in time to see the four cars
reared high in the air, leaving the track and with a
great jump landing, askew, to plunge end over end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
down the side of the gulch, while the ties and rails
sailed in all directions.</p>

<p>They evidently had struck a tie, at last. A minute
more, and with whistle open but throttle closed, and
the brakeman and Pat scampering from brake to brake,
and the scattered section-men gaping, the train rolled
triumphant and breathless into Echo City.</p>

<p>The crash of the wreck had been heard. Men ran
up track at best speed; down jumped Paddy and the
brakeman, and ran, too; with a “Come on, quick!”
George legged to see, and Terry panted after.</p>

<p>The wreck was half a mile back; a crowd had already
gathered around it—were laughing and whooping,
and no wonder: for here were the two Dutchmen,
sitting on the bank of the ditch, one of them smoking
his pipe, and both well dazed but unharmed. They
had been aboard, after all!</p>

<p>“An’ for why didn’t yez set the brakes?” Pat was
storming. “Did yez want to kill us all?”</p>

<p>“We knowed noddings,” said the man with the
pipe. “Why didn’t you wake us oop, to tell what
the troubles vas?”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t yez say yez were aslape, so we’d
wake yez up before wastin’ all the steam by whistlin’
to no use?” raged Pat. “Now look at the ties an’
rails an’ four good cars fed to yez, an’ the Cintral
Paycific tryin’ to bate us into Ogden!”</p>

<p>The two Dutchmen really had been fast asleep on a
load of ties; and as they had said, they “knowed noddings”
about any “troubles” until they found themselves
landed with a thump upon this bank!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>Not for some days did Pat get done grumbling at
the “waste o’ steam an’ time an’ good cars”; but
another event speedily made him change his tune.</p>

<p>“Th’ C. Pay.” were already coming up “th’ U.
Pay.” canyon, out of Ogden!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>THE LAST STRETCH</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Th’</span> C. Pay. are this side o’ Ogden an’ a-comin’
up th’ U. Pay. grade!”</p>

<p>Those were the very words, plainly heard by Terry
and George both; but the startling news seemed unbelievable.
Pat straightened and gaped.</p>

<p>“What? Say that ag’in. Ye don’t mane the
tracks!”</p>

<p>“No; not yit. But, b’ gorry, th’ C. Pay. ingineers
have drove their stakes, an’ th’ C. Pay. Mongolians
have follered in, an’ th’ dirt’ll soon be flyin’ on two
grades instead o’ wan, in the same canyon, jist ahid.”</p>

<p>“An’ where’s their ind o’ track, then? Tell me
that,” stammered Pat.</p>

<p>“Wan hunderd an’ fifty mile to th’ west’rd still.
Yez’ll bate ’em into Ogden wid th’ rails, but it’s
smart they be. For haven’t they thrown their men
beyant themselves, to grade clane through Ogden an’
into th’ mountains, so whilst th’ U. Pay. is a-claimin’
to Humboldt Wells, th’ C. Pay.’ll be filin’ a map wid
th’ Prisident at Washington claimin’ their own rights,
an’ pay accordin’, t’rough th’ Salt Lake Valley.”</p>

<p>“It’s the rails that’ll count,” Pat retorted. “We’ll
be first wid the rails—wan continuous line, mark
ye—an’ whilst they’re a-comin’ we’ll be still a-goin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“They’re over th’ Humboldt Mountains, an’ they
say they’ll be layin’ their six mile a day, on th’ level.”</p>

<p>“If they lay their six mile a day we’ll lay our siven
an’ eight,” growled Pat. “An’ bad luck to their
Chinks who get in the way o’ the Irish.”</p>

<p>“Golly! Hope I’ll get in often enough to see the
fun,” chuckled George, to Terry. “You’ll be down
in front among the graders—expect there’ll be some
mix-ups when the two gangs meet.”</p>

<p>“There would be if the U. P. graders were Irish;
but the gangs between here and Ogden are Brigham
Young’s Mormons. I don’t believe they’ll fight with
the Chinamen. And Pat’s track-layers won’t stop to
fight, yet.”</p>

<p>The wreck was left for the Echo City crews to clean
up. Pat forgot it; his sole thought now was to put the
rails into Ogden. Orders reached him from Superintendent
Reed to let the C. P. gangs strictly alone and
attend only to the U. P. business. Out of Echo Canyon
shot the track, and down the marvelous Weber
Canyon, with every mile getting lower and nearer to
Ogden.</p>

<p>Yes, the C. P. were in here. First, a few advance
stakes were to be noted, piloting an up grade almost
parallel with the U. P. down grade. Then a bunch
of C. P. location surveyors were sighted, camped
across the way. But all eyes were peeled for a sight
of the “Chinks” themselves—those C. P. graders of
whom so much had been said.</p>

<p>The end o’ track, pushed forward at top speed as it
wound snakelike through the canyon, passed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
Thousand Mile Tree (a lone pine, beside the grade, on
which the location surveyors had hung the sign “1000
Miles”), and twenty-four miles farther sort of burst
into view of the Great Salt Lake Valley at last.</p>

<p>The Mormon graders were under separate contract
and separate bosses, so that as timekeeper Terry had
nothing to do with them. And he was with the Irish
track-construction crew when end o’ track forged by
the C. P. grade.</p>

<p>“Th’ Chinymin! Be them th’ Chinymin? Faith,
look at ’em wance! Ain’t they th’ craturs, to be
workin’ alongside white min?”</p>

<p>For there they were, the Central Pacific graders, in
Union Pacific territory—and Chinamen, sure enough!</p>

<p>“The first I ever saw,” quoth Pat, while he and the
other men eyed them askance. “A quare lot, I must
say.”</p>

<p>A queer lot indeed, where in noon camp, wearing
enormously brimmed wicker hats like flat over-turned
bowls, and quilted blouses with large sleeves, and
flappy blue-cotton trousers, and stubby shoes, they
squatted around huge bowls of steaming rice and fished
out the grains with their chop-sticks.</p>

<p>“I hear tell they work for a dollar a day an’ find
themselves wid rice an’ pork,” pursued Pat. “Well,
they look it. Sure ’twould be shame to insult a shillaly
wid breakin’ it on the crown o’ such pore craturs—an’
all I ask is that they kape out o’ me way.”</p>

<p>The Chinamen scarcely tilted their heads, under
their bowl-shaped hats, to gaze at their rivals; and the
rails went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“’Tis a fairish grade they’re buildin’,” Pat sized
up, cocking his eye. “But who cares? The rails are
what’ll count, an’ we’re out o’ the mountains an’
more’n a few o’ them Chinks are naded to stop a
U. Pay. gang.”</p>

<p>Out of the mountains! Date, last of February.
Mileage in the two months, sixty, not including the
sidings: but a tough sixty, battling the snows and
frozen earth and the many curves.</p>

<p>Beautiful lay the Salt Lake Valley, under a bright
sun; its thrifty Mormon ranches showing green, its
towns clearly blocked, and the Great Salt Lake shimmering
like silver, in the middle, with the desert
ranges bluish beyond.</p>

<p>“Where’s Ogden, now?”</p>

<p>“How fur to Ogden?”</p>

<p>And——</p>

<p>“Where’s th’ C. Pay. track?”</p>

<p>“Only nine mile north’rd ’round the base o’ the
mountains, to Ogden, lads,” Pat cheered. “Hooray!
Lave the dollar-a-day haythen to their gradin’ an’
their bits o’ rice, for they’ll have mainly their trouble
as their pay. Their rails are a hunderd miles yit out
on the desert t’other side them high ridges. Wan
more sprint for us, an’ there we are, wid ’ase.”</p>

<p>This night there was much excitement in the boarding-train
and the camps pitched alongside.</p>

<p>“We’ve bate ’em! We’ve bate ’em! Nigh 500
miles in under tin months ag’in their 400, an’ the
dead o’ winter ketchin’ us in the mountains, to boot!”</p>

<p>Three days of rush; and the first week of March,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
this 1869, Paddy Miles’ track-construction gang entered
Ogden. Distance from Omaha, 1033.4 miles.</p>

<p>In rolled the pay-car, with George aboard, his eyes
snapping.</p>

<p>“Did you see those Chinamen?” he demanded.
“Did you have any fight?”</p>

<p>In rolled the freights, and the first passenger train.
Already the Government had accepted the track as far
as the Thousand Mile Tree.</p>

<p>George and Terry climbed to a hill-side high above
Ogden. Below, the track gangs and the tie-layers
were celebrating; the Mormon citizens joined in.
Whistles blew—the hoarse siren of old 119 rose victorious,
and the whistle of the boarding-train engine
tried to out-do. It was a great event, but many eyes
were peering off into the northwest, like the eyes of the
junior pay department.</p>

<p>“Can you see the C. P. grade?” queried George.</p>

<p>“Reckon I can. Look around the north end of the
lake, to that humpy point that sticks into it. Wish I
had a glass.”</p>

<p>“I see! Anyhow, I think I see—looks like there
was a gang at work on top the ridge.”</p>

<p>“Jim Bridger or Sol Judy could tell. That’s Promontory Point,
and both lines cross it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t see any rails, though! That’s only end
o’ grade—the real grade. C. P. end o’ track is
clear the other side of Promontory, and Promontory’s
fifty miles.”</p>

<p>“But look at our own grade, boy! It’s almost to
Promontory, itself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“Hi!” George chuckled. “Reckon we’re bound
right through, across Utah for Humboldt Wells in
Nevada. And when those two grades mix, some day,
there’s liable to be tall doings between the Paddies and
the Chinks.”</p>

<p>Excitement continued to reign in Ogden. Matters
had taken a surprising turn. The Union Pacific was
here first; nobody could deny that, and it proceeded to
make good its foothold by occupying all the ground
possible, with Pat Miles laying a maze of switches and
side-tracks under the direction of Major Hurd. For
Ogden was the key to the Salt Lake Valley and the
vast trade with the Mormon settlers who would ship
out produce and ship in supplies. Salt Lake City was
only thirty-five miles south—a branch road would
be built to it, of course. Then——</p>

<p>But the Central people also were claiming Ogden as
a terminal. They had jumped across 100 miles of
country and with Mormon help were running a roadbed
out of Ogden and eastward up Weber Canyon,
for Echo City, forty miles! They had filed a map, at
Washington, showing that their line was being completed
into Ogden and beyond—and almost on the
very day that the Union Pacific track had entered
Ogden the Central Pacific vice-president, Mr. C. P.
Huntington, had been given by the Government a portion
of the payment due, at $32,000 a mile, on that new
division of the road.</p>

<p>“Now if the Gover’mint’s ag’in us——!” Pat
complained. “Sure, have we got to stop right here,
when our eyes are set on Humboldt Wells, 200 mile beyant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
an’ the ingineers have marked the way, an’ the
tracks are ready to foller. Not a single rail can the C.
Pay. show, inside a hundred miles. B’ gorry, though,
they have smart min, not countin’ their pig-tailed haythen.”</p>

<p>“We’re going on!” George announced.</p>

<p>Being close to the pay-department quarters, he heard
considerable straight talk; and this time he was not
mistaken. Mr. Sidney Dillon, of the board of directors,
had come out from New York. He and General
Dodge and General Casement and other officials had a
meeting; President Oliver Ames and Vice-President
Thomas Durant had made a big protest to Washington
and Congress was going to investigate the claims of the
Central Pacific; the word was: “Forward, march, to
Humboldt Wells,” and, as said Pat: “Niver mind the
rice-’atin’ Mongolians. We’ll tach ’em how the Irish
handle the pick.”</p>

<p>“We’re getting out of money, but don’t you tell,”
George confided, to Terry, on the quiet. “It took over
$10,000,000 extra, for the work last winter. Gosh! I
tell you we fellows in the pay-car have to figure mighty
close.”</p>

<p>But the race was on again, just the same—only
worse. General Dodge and General Casement met the
Central Pacific deal by sending a large gang of Paddy’s
track-layers ahead 200 miles across country, to begin
a track into Humboldt Wells. And out of Ogden the
main track was shoved toward Promontory Point, with
the graders working ahead, on the U. P. survey.</p>

<p>Track-laying had slackened. It was a long, long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
haul, now, from Omaha, more than 1000 miles, across
the plains where the Sioux were still fighting the iron
horse, and across the mountains where the storms of
spring raged and the snow-slides ran. And the track-layers
and graders both had threatened to strike, because
of lack of pay.</p>

<p>But the Central likewise was having trouble. The
Central, too, was far from its iron—ships bringing
the rails and spikes and fastenings around Cape Horn
or up from the Isthmus of Panama were sunk, becalmed,
delayed; the Nevada desert was bare of forage
for the horses; and for days at a time the Central work-gangs
sat idle and discontented.</p>

<p>The two railroads resembled two staggering long-distance
runners, almost exhausted as each struggled
on, from opposite directions, to breast the tape.</p>

<p>The Central grade came eastward by its own survey,
which was not at all the Union Pacific survey; and
that was a funny thing—the two roads working as
hard as they could, to meet, and yet not meeting.</p>

<p>The C. P. grade had swung around the north end of
the Salt Lake, and down over Promontory Point—which
was the high point that jutted into the lake.
The U. P. grade had been launched northward from
Ogden, along the lake shore, as if to drive the C. P.
grade back. And slow work the grading was, because
the country was cut by streams and rocky ridges, running
into the boggy marge of the lake itself.</p>

<p>On some stretches the surveys were a mile separated—on
others they approached close to each
other. The grades would do the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“As long as the two gangs are a mile apart, ’twill be
a paceful country yon,” quoth Pat; “for a high fince
makes good neighbors, ye understand. But,” he added,
kindly, to Terry, “when they’re a-workin’ side by
side like, I’d advise ye to ride wid an eye open an’
an umbrelly up. Some o’ them blastin’ crews are
liable to lay a ‘grave,’ an’ I wouldn’t want ye hurt.”</p>

<p>Just what Pat meant by a “grave,” Terry did not
know, but he was speedily to find out.</p>

<p>On a morning when he rode out, in advance of U.
P. end o’ track, for his regular “time inspection,” the
two grades were passing each other at last. The C.
P. grade was holding to the higher ground, here.
The long line of busy Chinamen (“Crocker’s pets,”
they were called, Mr. Charles Crocker being the C. P.
superintendent of construction) were toiling away,
with pick and spade and wheel-barrow, right above
the long line of flannel-shirted Irishmen building the
U. P. grade.</p>

<p>The Chinamen were saying scarcely a word, and
casting scarcely a glance. They trotted with their
barrows, and pecked with short little stabs, but they
swarmed like rats. The Irish laughed among themselves,
making remarks not at all complimentary to
their rivals.</p>

<p>As Terry approached a cut, he suddenly ran into a
blast. That is, before ever he saw the red flag of
danger, cautious voices in low tone, and sly gestures
warned him.</p>

<p>“Whisht, now! Look out. Stand where ye be.”</p>

<p>There was no red flag, and no shout; but heads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
were being turned, along the grade—in the cut the
men were pausing, poised, ready to jump—everybody
seemed aware, except the Chinamen above the
cut; and amidst a sudden scattering for cover by the
cut men, up burst the blast itself.</p>

<p>The rocks soared high, specking the air, and rained
down, volleying among the Chinamen. The Chinamen
squeaked with fright, and ducked and scurried,
but several were bowled over.</p>

<p>This appeared to tickle the Irish graders immensely.
They pretended to pay no attention; only grinned
broadly, as they resumed work, while the Chinamen
yelped protests, and shook helpless fists.</p>

<p>“But maybe you killed some of ’em, Mike,” Terry
gasped, considerably flustered, himself.</p>

<p>“Them Chinks?” rasped Big Mike, the grade boss
here. “Aw, now, don’t ye worry. Let ’em look out
for themselves. Our orders be, to pay no attintion
to the C. Pay. grade; we’ve our own work. What
are they doin’ here, anyhow, right ferninst the blastin’?
They ought to know enough to kape away.
An’ a ‘grave’ is a blessin’ to a Chinyman—for as
soon as he’s dead, ain’t he sint back to the ould
country?”</p>

<p>So that was a “grave,” was it? Huh! After that
Terry moved cautiously, when taking time; for other
“graves” were “opened” by the cunning U. P.
graders. They willingly enough dodged the rocks,
themselves, in the hopes of “burying” some of the
timid “Crocker’s pets.”</p>

<p>Superintendent Crocker made complaint straight to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
General Casement and General Dodge; and General
Casement and Superintendent Reed ordered Big Mike
to stop that nonsense among his men. Big Mike only
promised—and that day another “grave” was
laid.</p>

<p>Then the Chinamen took matters into their own
hands. They also “opened” a “grave,” smack
above a bevy of the Irish. It was a large one; it
buried three Irishmen completely—killed two of
them and wounded half a dozen others.</p>

<p>Big Mike was reported to have at first roared like a
bull, for revenge, and to have finished by scratching
his thatch ruefully.</p>

<p>“B’ gorry,” he said, “if it’s a game two can play
at, they have the advantage o’ position. Before me
min get nervous mebbe we’d better call it quits.”</p>

<p>And back at end o’ track Pat remarked:</p>

<p>“’Tis a wonder them haythens didn’t have the same
sinse before. Now I guess there’ll be no more
‘graves,’ yon, o’ that kind.”</p>

<p>U. P. end o’ track was twenty miles out of Ogden,
and half way to Promontory Point. C. P. end o’
track was eighty miles out, or thirty miles the other
side of Promontory Point. One end o’ track was
going one way, the other end o’ track was coming the
other way; but they were not aimed to meet!</p>

<p>“On to Humboldt Wells,” was the slogan of the
Union Pacific.</p>

<p>“On to Ogden,” was the slogan of the Central
Pacific.</p>

<p>Not until the U. P. grade had climbed Promontory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
to join with its grade in the desert beyond, and
the C. P. grade was touching Ogden, did the fresh
news break.</p>

<p>Pat received a telegram, read it, and burst into a
flurry.</p>

<p>“It’s all off! The orders be for us to join ind o’
track wid the Cintral ind atop o’ Promontory Summit—an’
shame on us if we let ’em bate us there. A
holiday in Salt Lake City wid full pay for iv’ry man
o’ yez if yez’ll step on the tails of the tie-layers wid
your rails.”</p>

<p>So it was to be a race for the meeting at Promontory
Summit! Distance to go: Union Pacific, twenty-eight
miles; Central Pacific, thirty miles. The telegraph
was already in operation, waiting to announce
the victor, to the world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>THE U. P. BREASTS THE TAPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> C. P. say they can lay ten miles of track in
one day and Mr. Durant has telegraphed $10,000 to
say they can’t do it!”</p>

<p>This was the excited greeting by George Stanton,
when Terry met the pay-car in the latest “roaring”
town of Blue Creek, at the base of Promontory Point
on the U. P. side.</p>

<p>Blue Creek station was not really a town; it was
more of a higglety-pigglety railroad camp, but it
seemed to know no law. The Home Cooking restaurant
appeared to be about the only decent place there.
Nevertheless, there it was, just the same, arrived in
its last move on the long journey from Cheyenne,
more than 500 miles. The “Heroines of the U. P.”
had set out to keep near their “men folks,” and bring
“home” to them whenever possible. Old 119, with
Engineer Richards in the cab, was still plying back
and forth, in the fore; and George’s father was expected
any day, called in from the Nevada surveys.</p>

<p>As soon as the two companies, directed by Congress,
had decided to join ends o’ tracks upon Promontory
Point, all advance grading and surveying had ceased.
The C. P. had graded eighty miles east from Promontory
Point, or almost to Echo City; the U. P. had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
graded 220 miles west from Ogden, or to Humboldt
Wells, and had laid eighty miles of track this way
from Humboldt Wells; but there was nothing doing
now. The work had all been wasted.</p>

<p>So the majority of the graders had been discharged.
A number of them still hung around, though, waiting
for the tracks to join. They helped to form the U.
P. camp of Blue Creek; and on the desert over beyond
the Summit they helped to form the on-coming C. P.
camp.</p>

<p>Everybody was keen to hear if the Central had
anything yet to say about the U. P. track-laying
record. Time was growing short. But the Central
had said little. It was reported that they had had
hard luck. Iron was scarce, and in order to make up
for lost hours they had laid track at night, by the light
of sage-brush bonfires. Now they were out of rails,
again. Their “iron-train,” as they called it, had been
ditched, by a broken trestle.</p>

<p>The Union Pacific crept on, here to the foot of
Promontory Point of the rugged Promontory Range;
the meeting-place agreed upon was only nine miles up
and over, and the track-layers might take things a
little easy.</p>

<p>But the Central had braced; they had the spirit,
all right, and those seven and five-eighths miles as a
challenge did not bluff them.</p>

<p>George brought the answer.</p>

<p>“We’ll lay ten miles of track in one day’s stint,”
was the telegraphed announcement of Superintendent
Crocker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“Ten thousand dollars that you can’t do it,” was
the reply of Mr. Durant, the U. P. vice-president,
from New York. “Choose your time and place and
we’ll have men there to see.”</p>

<p>“Tin miles? Those fellers?” Pat scoffed.
“Eight’s the limit o’ any gang. Haven’t we stumped
’em wid sivin an’ a bit? If they lay tin miles I’ll
crawl over it on me hands an’ knees wid me nose
countin’ the ties!”</p>

<p>“When’ll they try? Did you hear?” demanded
Terry, of George.</p>

<p>“No. All I saw was in the Ogden paper. Expect
they’ll choose the levelest place they have. You bet
I’m going to be there.”</p>

<p>“So am I!”</p>

<p>“We’ll all be there,” Pat proclaimed. “For we’ll
have nothin’ else to do. Wid only nine miles yet to
lay we’ll all be on vacation soon; an’ if they don’t
finish their tin miles, the Irish will stand ready to help
’em along to the meetin’ spot.”</p>

<p>“How far out are they?” asked George.</p>

<p>“Eighteen or twenty miles. That wreck stopped
’em.”</p>

<p>Up Promontory Point the U. P. rails labored, for
the finish; with trestles and curves, and several switchbacks
that doubled like the letter “S”—for there
were grades of 110 feet to the mile, and the cuts and
fills were many. Water had to be hauled in tanks,
again, for cooking and drinking. In fact this finish
was one of the toughest pulls in all the 1,080 miles.</p>

<p>On April 27, they topped the last rise. This summit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
of Promontory Point was a flattish plateau, dropping
off at the other side into the desert. The grade
led almost straight across—a mile and a half or two
miles there was a collection of tents and shacks, and
the men paused to stare.</p>

<p>“The meetin’-place? Is that yon the meetin’-place,
ye say?”</p>

<p>“Right, me bullies,” Pat encouraged. “’Tis the
ind o’ 550 miles o’ rails laid in thirteen months, b’
gorry, not countin’ the eighty that’s been wasted. So
we’ll knock off ’arly, an’ tomorrow we’ll make in—an’
be frish for the nixt mornin’ when the Cintral
Chinks start to lay their tin that they’re braggin’ beforehand
about. Sure, that’ll lave ’em four miles yit.
Like as not they’ll nade help wid their finish.”</p>

<p>“It’s a quare meetin’-place, where there’s nothin’
to meet,” some of the men laughed. “S’pose we
tiligraph Congress, just sayin’ that th’ U. Pay.’ll kape
a-goin’ an’ save th’ C. Pay. th’ bother.”</p>

<p>“Not much! Tin miles o’ track are they to lay in
wan day, remember, wid us a-lookin’ on.”</p>

<p>Mr. J. H. Strobridge, the C. P. superintendent of
track-construction, finally had sent word to Mr. Reed,
the U. P. superintendent, that on April 29 the Central
would lay their ten miles of track, from a point fourteen
miles short of the meeting-place. He invited the
U. P. to send witnesses—President Leland Stanford,
of the Central Pacific (and ex-governor of
California), and other C. P. officials would be there.</p>

<p>“We’ll be there, too,” had wired back Mr. Reed.</p>

<p>“We’ll be there,” had asserted Pat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>Before noon of April 28, the U. P. end o’ track
came to a rest near the idling camp of Promontory,
where a lot of ex-graders were squatted, and gamblers,
eating-house keepers, liquor sellers and real-estate
boomers had arrived, to await events.</p>

<p>One rail’s length short of the stake and flag, the
track stopped—obeying orders from Mr. Reed.</p>

<p>Hats were flung into the air, tools went hurtling,
cheers rang riotous, and George, who had hopped a
ride up from Blue Creek, so as to be on hand, danced
a war-dance with Terry.</p>

<p>“Done! Hurrah! Done!”</p>

<p>“Why do yez say ‘done,’ when ’tain’t done at all,
at all?” reproved red-headed little Jimmie Muldoon,
severely. “Do yez expec’ the ingines to walk the ties,
th’ same as me horse? It won’t be done until th’ C.
Pay. lay their fourteen mile—an’ Pat says that
mebbe we’ll have to fall in an’ help ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re done, all but twenty-eight feet,” retorted
George. “And if the C. P. lay their ten miles
tomorrow, they’ll be about done. Four miles more is
nothing. Not out of nearly 2,000. We all can pitch
in and lay that in an hour. Come on, Terry, let’s
figure.”</p>

<p>They sat down, to figure.</p>

<p>Union Pacific: forty miles of track laid in 1865;
260 miles in 1866; 246 miles in 1867; 425 miles in
1868, and now 125, in the four months of 1869—which
made, as Pat said, 550 miles in thirteen months,
not counting the sidings and switches, and the eighty
miles at Humboldt Wells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>And look at the grading! From Sherman to Humboldt
Wells—725 miles, in the same thirteen months.</p>

<p>“I reckon nobody’s going to beat that, for a
while,” vaunted George, the boss figurer.</p>

<p>“Reckon not, boy. But the C. P. have done pretty
well. While we’ve been building 1,086 miles, and
that extra ‘Z’ of near ten miles more, they’ve been
building something like 675, with those fourteen miles
yet to go on; but they’ll match our 550 miles in thirteen
months with 549, ’cording to Major Hurd. Not
much difference—huh?”</p>

<p>“Shucks! Don’t forget our other eighty. And
besides, you fellows have been sort of loafing along,
lately; and now you’re sitting here waiting. You
could have been past ’em and part way to Humboldt
Wells, if the Government hadn’t stopped you. You’ve
been bucking the mountains, too, while they’ve had the
desert.”</p>

<p>“They had the mountains in the beginning and we
had the plains,” Terry reminded. “But, anyhow, if
they’ll lay ten miles of track tomorrow, I’ll take off my
hat to the Chinks.”</p>

<p>“So’ll I,” George agreed.</p>

<p>“I’ll ate mine,” declared Jimmie Muldoon. “An’
I’ll ate my brother’s, too. But say: is that what your
figgers show? Have we all come wid the rails 550
miles in scarce more’n wan year?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing, Jimmie.”</p>

<p>“Glory be!” sighed Jimmie. “An’ me on the
back of a horse, doublin’ the distance tin times iv’ry
mile! Faith, I’ll ride back on the train. An’ what’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
th’ whole distance, by miles, from Omyha to this place
here?”</p>

<p>“One thousand and eighty-six miles, Jimmie.”</p>

<p>Jimmie uttered an Irish whoop.</p>

<p>“I’ve ridden a horse around the world,” he shouted.
“But wance is enough. A reg’lar cin-taur I be!”</p>

<p>George had leave to spend the rest of the day here.
That was good. It insured his being on hand bright
and early, for the great event, tomorrow.</p>

<p>The track-layers knocked off work. With many
of them, the long job was finished. Only a few were
to be needed, now, and the rest only waited for their
pay, or for the joining of the tracks.</p>

<p>They lay around, smoking their pipes, or celebrated
in the Promontory camp, or proceeded down to Blue
Creek, where there was more amusement. A crew
of the track ballasters proceeded to settle the ties.
The boarding-train stood at ease, and the construction-train,
having unloaded, pulled out for Blue Creek, itself.
Jimmie Muldoon and his brother turned their
rail-truck horses out to grass.</p>

<p>The grade stretched on, across the flat summit, westward
still, and out of sight. Its ties had all been
placed; it needed only the Central Pacific rails. A
few Chinamen were working on it.</p>

<p>The summit of Promontory Point was a sort of
pass over the end of Promontory Range. It was a
plateau, covered with grass and sage-brush—a
basin held between a high ridge north and a high
ridge south. Only a glimpse of the shining Salt Lake
might be seen. But by climbing the south ridge, a
fellow got a fine view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>From here, all the mighty lake lay outspread, below,
fringed by its mountains and broken by its islands—one
could see the smoke of Ogden, thirty or so
miles in air-line although fifty-two by track, and even
of Salt Lake City, farther southeastward. And where
the grade westward dipped down from the plateau,
into the sagy desert, could be sighted the construction
camp of the Central Pacific people, fourteen miles
away.</p>

<p>“There’s a big crowd of ’em, all right,” Terry remarked.</p>

<p>“It’ll take a big crowd to bring up the stuff for ten
miles of track at once, and have iron and everything
ready.”</p>

<p>“Well,” mused Terry, “maybe they’ll do it and
maybe they won’t; but I wish our men could have a
try.”</p>

<p>When they went down to camp, General Dodge and
General Casement were inspecting the ground in company
with two visitors. One of these was a fine-looking,
trimmed-beard man in black broad-cloth (somewhat
dusty) and black soft hat with wide brim.</p>

<p>“That’s the Honorable Leland Stanford, ex-governor
of California—the Central’s president, and a
powerful smart man,” said the report in the U. P.
camp.</p>

<p>The other was an energetic, heavy-set man, with
masterful gray-blue eyes, a determined mouth, and
face smooth-shaven except for a thick moustache.</p>

<p>He was Mr. Charles Crocker, the Central’s road-builder—the
man who had hustled the work while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
Governor Stanford in the West and Mr. Huntington,
the vice-president, in the East, managed the money
end.</p>

<p>The two Central officials started to ride back to
their own line.</p>

<p>“By this time tomorrow, gentlemen, we’ll be nearing
the end of our ten miles,” Governor Stanford
bantered, on parting, as they turned their horses.</p>

<p>“You have our best wishes; you can’t come on any
too fast, for us—but we’ll be here to check up on
you,” laughed General Dodge.</p>

<p>He and General Casement passed near Terry and
George, who, like the other men, respectfully saluted.
General Dodge checked his horse.</p>

<p>“What do you boys think of this ten-mile-in-a-day
proposition?” he queried, with a twinkle in his tired
eyes. “How about it, Terry? You’ve watched our
Paddies for 800 miles, and General Casement says
they can beat the world.”</p>

<p>“If the Central can lay ten miles, our men can lay
eleven, sir,” Terry stoutly replied.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, they won’t have to,” rapped General
Casement. “But I’ll wager that they could, myself.”</p>

<p>This evening, and into the night, the bonfires of
sage-brush built by the U. P. camp were answered by
the distant glow of the bonfires built by the C. P.
camp. The two camps were like the camps of two
armies waiting for a test of strength on the morrow.</p>

<small>THE C. P. SHOW THEIR METTLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Seven</span> o’clock in the morning of April 29, 1869.</p>

<p>Since before daybreak the people from the U. P.
camp had been streaming westward down the grade,
toward the C. P. camp. Afoot, ahorse and by
wagon they hastened along, to arrive in time for the
track-laying contest.</p>

<p>Track Boss Paddy Miles was here, with Big Mike
the grading boss, in a graders’ wagon; George had
found a mule for hire, and had ridden over with
Terry; the two Muldoon lads were here, on their
gaunt rail-truck nags; half of Promontory was here;
General Dodge, General Casement and his brother Dan
Casement, Superintendent Reed, Major Hurd—they
had come up from below; and there was a delegation
of U. P. surveyors and Mormon citizens, from
Ogden and even from Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>The edge of the plateau was alive with wagons,
carts, horses, mules, and figures on foot, forging on
for the Central end o’ track.</p>

<p>The Central folks seemed to be in no great hurry.
The sun was above the Wasatch Range, pouring his
beams upon the plateau and ridges of Promontory
Point. At the very tip of the Central track waited the
C. P. rail-truck, or iron-car—a low flat-car shorter
than the U. P. rail-trucks. It was heaped high with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
rails, spikes and fastenings; and on either side of end
o’ track were other piles of iron.</p>

<p>A long iron-train, and the boarding-train behind it,
stood with steam up, as far forward as they could get.
Ranged along the iron-truck the rail-placers were
ready; they were white—for, as Pat said, “yez
can’t get along widout the whites, no matter how many
Chinymin yez have!” Behind this squad were the
first spikers and bolters (“white min, too, mark ye!”)
and two groups of Chinamen, also with sledges and
with wrenches. And behind these extended, in parallel
lines two deep, still more Chinamen—the ballasters
with spades and picks.</p>

<p>A host of other Chinamen were gathered, chattering
and laughing, to watch the work begin.</p>

<p>Now the U. P. men had a good chance to size up
the C. P. track-crew and grade-builders—mainly
those “haythen Chinese” who lived on tea, rice and
pork (and rats, as Pat asserted); who fed no “roaring”
towns, who did not get drunk, who gave no
trouble to the bosses, and who asked only their dollar-a-day,
and tended strictly to business; but who had
been buried by snow in the Sierras, had worked in the
fire-light on the soda-whitened Nevada desert, and
now were arrayed to “show the Melicans.”</p>

<p>The track boss was white—Hi Minkler; Mr.
H. H. Minkler, that is. He was passing to and fro,
with sly words to keep the crews on edge. The man
who met the U. P. officials and ushered them on to
Governor Stanford and the other Central officials was
Mr. James Campbell, superintendent of the C. P. Salt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
Lake Division. Mr. Strobridge, the C. P. construction
superintendent, shook hands with the U. P. superintendent,
Mr. Reed; and Mr. Crocker, the C. P.
chief of construction, who ranked the same as General
Casement, bustled anxiously here and there, on
last inspections.</p>

<p>“Gee! They’d better begin,” spoke George.</p>

<p>“Longer they wait, the better for us,” proposed
Terry.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want ’em to win out?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. Why—yes, sure! If they can do
it, let ’em. I guess they deserve it, and ’twon’t harm
anybody. The U. P. is through. We beat to Promontory.”</p>

<p>Mr. Strobridge had been looking at his watch.
He snapped it shut, instantly caught Track Boss
Minkler’s eyes—“Go ahead!” he barked.</p>

<p>“Lay to it!” roared Boss Minkler.</p>

<p>The air rocked to a sudden peal of cheers; but before
the first note had issued, four rails at once were
being laid; the nearest two rails on either side of the
rail-car had been seized, each, by two men with tongs
or nippers, carried forward at a run, and plunked
down upon the ties as a starter!</p>

<p>Right away, without waiting for spikes or bolts,
a crew of other men had put their shoulders to the
little car and rolled it onward to the end of the second
pair of rails; the first spikers and bolters jumped to
set a couple of spikes, clap on the fish-plate fasteners,
and thrust a bolt or so through, while the gaugers measured
and two crow-bar men stood ready to line up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>The Chinese spikers and bolt-screwers were on
their heels, to drive the spikes and tighten the fish-plate
bolts—but before this another pair of rails were
down and the rail-car had advanced again!</p>

<p>In their parallel double lines the Chinese ballasters
were coming, like a well-drilled company. They
numbered fifty. The inner lines carried spades, the
outer lines carried picks. The spades scraped and
shoveled and tamped, between the ties; the picks rose
and fell, piling up the dirt along the ends; thus the
ties were settled and the track leveled, like lightning.</p>

<p>“Keep back, everybody!” shouted Superintendent
Strobridge, as the people crowded and craned.</p>

<p>“In the name o’ the saints, wad yez look at ’em
travel!” That was the exclamation of Paddy Miles,
who had pressed afoot into the front rank of spectators,
and was staring agape.</p>

<p>General Casement had his watch out.</p>

<p>“Five lengths of rail to the minute!” he announced.</p>

<p>“Gee! One hundred and forty feet!” gasped
George. “How many minutes to the mile, then?”</p>

<p>“Not much over thirty. They’re liable to do two
miles an hour, if they keep up,” Terry calculated.</p>

<p>The rail-truck was partly unloaded; at a bark from
Boss Minkler a lot of Chinamen dumped the remaining
rails at end o’ track—and back down track
rumbled the car, its crew at a dead run, for the near
supply while the rail-layers were working.</p>

<p>It had not stopped before it was being reloaded at
top pace; and back it charged, for end o’ track again.
The Chinamen in its path barely sprang aside; then
bent once more to their jobs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>The track had been lengthened by half a mile!
“Toot, toot!” and “Toot, toot!” signaled the two
engines at rear. Here they came, too, with their
fresh supplies, halted upon the newly laid track,
dumped more ammunition, and backed out, to clear.</p>

<p>The work never slackened for the trotting rail-layers
to ease their arms. The spikers and bolters
pushed them hard—the Chinamen rarely uttered a
word, as they shuffled forward, machine-like. Every
man on the job was dripping with sweat. The car
crew—Chinamen, they—strained and panted as
they shoved at the heavy car; suddenly at a word they
fell out and another crew dived into their places.</p>

<p>Along the squads from rear to front and back to
rear hurried the water-carriers, with dippers and
splashing buckets, ladling right and left.</p>

<p>To keep up with the rails the crowd had to be constantly
on the move, themselves; end o’ track was
always getting away from them.</p>

<p>It all was so exciting that time flew, like the track.</p>

<p>“Major Hurd says eight-thirty—one hour,” uttered
George. “And now look at where they started,
at those last tents. Back a mile and a half, or more!”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe they can keep it up.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got 4,000 men to draw on; mostly
Chinks.”</p>

<p>“Only so many can work at once. It takes a lot of
practice to lay rails and drive spikes just right.”</p>

<p>“If they do keep it up, they’ll have time to spare.
Maybe they’ll go straight on to the U. P. track, fourteen
miles!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>The C. P. men were so well drilled that they worked
without signals. “Plunk, plink, plink, plank,”
sounded the rails, dropped as regularly as a clock ticks—a
pair of rails every ten seconds! “Whang,
whang, whang, whang whangity-whang, whang,
whang!” clanged the sledges, with one continuous
rapid-fire. The spades rang and the picks thudded,
and the Chinamen grunted. Up to end o’ track, end
o’ track, end o’ track again, rolled the iron-truck—every
minute, as seemed, boomed back, shoved by its
sweating crew, for another supply, and charged in
through the midst of the pig-tailed, grunting ballasters,
who flowed together again in its wake. The
iron-train edged onward, ready.</p>

<p>Track Boss Minkler held the fore, darting from
crew to crew, inspecting, scolding, praising, calling the
attention of the gang bosses to now this, now that, and
seeing that the rails did not lack. He was sweaty and
grimy—worked as hard as any other man. Pat
Miles could have done no more.</p>

<p>Chief Superintendent Crocker rode restlessly hither-thither,
along the whole line from train to end o’
track—appeared to see nothing but the job, and he
saw everything there.</p>

<p>“Lay to it, boys. Workee allee time chop-chop,
John. No stopee till topside ten miles. Sabee?”</p>

<p>And the Chinamen answered, with shrill little yaps:</p>

<p>“Hi-yah, Meestee Clocky. Workee chop-chop, you
bet.”</p>

<p>“Golly! At the third mile-stake, already,” said
George, while the procession moved on. “’Tisn’t
more than nine o’clock, either!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“Shucks!” Terry blurted. “These C. P. fellows
could build a whole track, grade and all, ten miles in a
day, at the rate they’re going. Wonder if they’ll
quit for noon.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got the dead-wood on Paddy Miles,
sure,” George chuckled. “Look at him, with his
mouth open and his pipe out!”</p>

<p>Higher rose the hot sun; still the rails clanked, and
the sledges whanged, and the iron-truck rumbled, and
the picks thudded, and the spades scraped, and ever
and anon the two trains tooted their “coming up”
signal. The air fairly quivered with action.</p>

<p>The sight was fascinating: the rail-layers, four on
a side, always on the run; the gaugers, clapping their
gauges to each pair of rails as soon as dropped; the
rail-truck, with its load projecting fore and aft, and
its pusher crew straining with bowed backs; the spike
and bolt placers, who never straightened but scurried,
head down, on the heels of the pushers; the Chinese
sledge men and wrench men, pressing closely; the two
double lines of ballasters, as busy and as orderly as
marching ants; Boss Minkler and Big Boss Crocker
prancing and urging; the iron-train dumping ahead of
time and pulling out for more; and all the grassy, sagy
slope, under a blue sky and fringed by desert mountains,
thronged with the intent spectators wearing
every sort of garb, from Governor Stanford’s broad-cloth
and General Dodge’s corduroys, down to the
U. P. red-flannel shirts and the C. P. cotton blouses.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! More than five miles, and they
aren’t going to stop for noon,” Terry gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>They didn’t. They went right along, for another
hour—they went along, until on a sudden Mr.
Crocker reined his horse at end o’ track, raised his
hand, dropped it sharply, as if driving a lance—</p>

<p>“That’ll do. Knock off.”</p>

<p>The men straightened, and stared about dazed,
while they wiped their brows.</p>

<p>“The six-mile stake, and the new station of Victory,”
shouted Mr. Crocker, to the crowd around.
“One thirty o’clock. Six miles of track laid in six
hours. We’ll take an hour’s rest.”</p>

<p>“B’ jabers, yez’ve earned it,” Pat bawled, just as a
great cheer answered the announcement. “Take two
hours; take thray.”</p>

<p>Mr. Crocker again raised his hand, for silence.</p>

<p>“There’ll be dinner for all, right here. Superintendent
Campbell is bringing up the boarding-train.”</p>

<p>The exhausted track-gang tossed down their tools,
and staggered aside, to drink, and wash, and throw
themselves down, also, for a breather until the cooks
beat the dinner gongs.</p>

<p>The dinner was served upon long tables set up in a
jiffy in the open air—but the Chinamen squatted
around their big kettles of rice and stew and tea. The
U. P. officials dined with President Stanford and the
other C. P. officials at a separate mess, near the
headquarters private car.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do? See it through?”
asked George, of Terry, while they cleaned their platters.</p>

<p>“I dunno. Guess there’s no doubt about those ten
miles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>“Well, I should say not! Only four miles yet, and
five hours to do them in. But let’s stick around.”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll stay as long as General Dodge
and the two Casements stay. Down on the plains we
used to think three miles was a big day’s work; but,
gee, these Central gangs can double that in half a
day!”</p>

<p>“So could the U. P. gangs, if they wanted to show
off,” George asserted. “Look what we did on the
Red Desert, and in the mountains last winter. We
could start in and lay twelve miles tomorrow, if we
had the chance.”</p>

<p>At two-thirty o’clock prompt the whistle of the
iron-train tooted one shrill blast. The C. P. track-crews
had been stationed for five minutes, poised and
waiting. The sweat had dried on them—they
were a bit stiff and tired; but they were game for the
finish. Like a machine when a lever has been pulled,
at the sound of the whistle they all broke into motion
again.</p>

<p>Some of the spectators left. It seemed to be a
certainty that the ten miles would be won, although of
course there might be a hitch. Four miles to be added
to six, in the shank of a day, was a chore.</p>

<p>On marched end o’ track, carried by these C. P.
cracks, and escorted by the expectant crowd; to the
seven-mile stake—and the eight-mile stake—but
backs and arms, and eyes also, were getting tired.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking toward the desert ranges in the
west; end o’ track was moving forward more slowly.</p>

<p>Terry measured the distance between sun and mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“Dunno whether they’ll do it or not. They’re
pretty well petered out. Those track-layers are plumb
tuckered. Reckon their hands and feet, both, are
blistered.”</p>

<p>“The spikers’ tongues are sure hanging out,” added
George. “’Twon’t be fair for ’em to work by night.
They’ve got to finish inside of a day.”</p>

<p>The U. P. officials were still here; so was Pat, and
Big Mike the grading boss, and quite a bunch of other
spectators who, like Terry and George, had resolved
to “stick it out.”</p>

<p>The nine-mile post! The sun now was low over
the western edge of Promontory Point.</p>

<p>“One more stake, boys,” hoarsely urged Boss Minkler.
“Plenty of time, if you just keep at it.”</p>

<p>“No stopee, John. Keep chop-chop. Almost topside,”
shouted Mr. Crocker.</p>

<p>“Hi-yah, Meesty Clocky. Keep chop-chop, make
topside, you bet,” panted the Chinamen.</p>

<p>The sun of April 29 was touching the western ridge;
the shadows of workers and spectators stretched long—the
rail-layers’ shadows seemed to lead on, marking
the way.</p>

<p>“What time is it?” Pat demanded.</p>

<p>“Close on seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“B’ dad, an’ they’ll make it, then; for yon’s the ten-mile
stake. Yis, an’ I hope they do, even if I have to
pay the $10,000 myself.”</p>

<p>Rail by rail it was, with the sweaty forms staggering
after, in the wake of the little rail-truck. Rail by
rail—only a few more needed——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>What! The ten-mile stake? Hooray! And
seven o’clock precisely! Ten miles of track, laid in
ten and one-half hours’ working time, or almost at the
rate of a mile an hour! A world’s record, by the
Central Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p>“Finish out the truck-load, boys,” bade Mr. Minkler.
“Give the U. P. good measure.”</p>

<p>And they finished the truck-load.</p>

<p>“Ten miles and 200 feet extra, gentlemen,” Mr.
Crocker announced. “Are you satisfied?”</p>

<p>“You win,” smiled General Dodge.</p>

<p>The track-crews eased their weary back, and tried
to smile, too; but they drooped as they leaned upon
their tools. The panting rail-carriers threw themselves
flat, exhausted.</p>

<p>“That was a giant’s feat, gentlemen,” proclaimed
Mr. Crocker. “I want to introduce to you these eight
men who carried ten miles of rails in one day, without
a pause except for nooning. Their names are Michael
Shay, Patrick Joyce, Thomas Daily, Michael Kennedy,
Fred McNamara, Edward Killeen, George
Wyatt, and Michael Sullivan. They’ve moved bodily
over a million and a half pounds of iron.”</p>

<p>The crowd cheered.</p>

<p>“An’ sivin of ’em are Irish, an’ the other ought to
be,” shouted Pat. “So it’s all in the family, an’ we
don’t begrudge yez the job. Faith,” he added, to his
rival, Track Boss Minkler, “a trifle over 2,000,000
pounds o’ iron have your gangs handled this day.
For hiven’s sake, send your min to bed, or my brain’ll
burst wid lookin’ at ’em. B’ dad, an’ wance I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
thought we could skin yez at the track game. Mebbe
we can—I’m not sayin’ we can’t, but we’re lucky
to quit before-time.”</p>

<p>“It’s laid and well laid,” Division Superintendent
Campbell was remarking, to General Casement.
“And to prove the fact, I’ll engage to run a locomotive
over the entire distance in forty minutes.”</p>

<p>So he did, on the return to the C. P. camp; but only
a few of the visitors remained, to witness. The sun
had set, soon the darkness would gather, and the bulk
of the crowd commenced to stream eastward, for
Promontory, the U. P. camp, Blue Creek, and even
beyond by wagon and train.</p>

<p>General Dodge and General Casement and Mr. Reed
stayed, to be the guests of Governor Stanford at supper.</p>

<p>“What do you reckon Pat meant by his 2,000,000
pounds?” George queried, as he and Terry cantered
on their way to camp. “All those figures sound like
heap talk.”</p>

<p>“Let’s ask Major Hurd.”</p>

<p>They dropped back to Major Hurd, the U. P. assistant
superintendent of construction.</p>

<p>“Crocker knows, and Pat made a shrewd guess,”
said Major Hurd. “It’s quickly figured. I have the
items right here.” And he consulted his pocket memorandum book.
“The C. P. are using thirty-foot rails,
weighing fifty-six pounds to the yard. In one mile
there should be 352 rails, each weighing 560 pounds,
and the total weight for ten miles sums 1,971,200
pounds, in rails alone. The ten miles calls for 55,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
spikes, 7,040 fish-plate fasteners, 14,080 bolts; and
while they may not bring the total quite to the 2,100,000
pounds, we’ll call it that in round numbers.
And every pound of the iron had to be handled—and
handled several times.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” sighed George, as if the very thought
made him tired. “Wonder when the next big show
will be.”</p>

<p>“Which?” Terry asked. “Pat counting the ties
with his nose? There are over 26,000 of them.”</p>

<p>“No. The joining of the tracks. The C. P. have
only four miles to go.”</p>

<p>“The wedding of the rails, you mean?” prompted
Major Hurd. “May 10 is the date suggested, I understand.
That will give both roads time to arrange
for a program and for bringing in the people who’ll
wish to come, from the East and West. General
Dodge is talking the matter over with Governor Stanford
now, so as to report to New York.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. We’ll stick around, then, I guess,”
George asserted. “I’ll have to stick, anyway,” he
added, to Terry, as they two rode ahead, “till the men
are all paid off. And maybe so will you.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t been paid, myself, for a month,” laughed
Terry. “But that doesn’t count. I’m going to see
this thing through. The wedding of the rails is liable
to be a regular humdinger of a celebration.”</p>

<small>THE WEDDING OF THE RAILS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Have</span> ye seen the grand tie that them Californy
people are givin’ toward the big doin’s tomorrow?”</p>

<p>Paddy Miles put the query to Terry, in the U. P.
construction camp on the border of the Salt Lake near
Blue Creek. The weather of the past few days had
turned raw, blustery and rainy. Both the U. P. and
the C. P. camps had been moved from the high windy
plateau down to lower ground. Now they were out of
sight of each other.</p>

<p>“No. What kind of a tie, Pat?”</p>

<p>“Red as rale mahogany, an’ polished like satin, an’
set wid a silver plate. ’Tis the last tie, to be laid
under the inds o’ the last rails.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Over yon in the C. Pay. special car, on the sidin’
back o’ their ind o’ track. Yes, an’ ’twixt you an’ me
(but ’tain’t to be repeated), there are two spikes o’
solid gold, wan of ’em topped wid a big nugget, an’
worth $400, come along wid it, an’ two silver spikes,
from Nevady an’ Arizony. Minkler’s guardin’ the
car, wid a squad o’ track men, but I dare say if you
go over an’ tell him I sent you, he’ll let you have a
peep.”</p>

<p>This was Sunday, May 9. The ceremony of laying
the last rails had been up in the air, so to say.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
President Stanford’s special car bringing a party of
C. P. officials and their guests, including the governor
of Arizona and dignitaries of Nevada, had arrived
on Promontory last Friday, the seventh, thinking that
the ceremony was to occur on Saturday, the eighth.</p>

<p>But General Casement had met them at U. P. end
o’ track with the Superintendent Reed special coach,
to tell them that the U. P. guests could not possibly
get in from the East before the tenth. So he had
taken them back to Ogden, on a sight-seeing tour of
the mountain country.</p>

<p>However, San Francisco had began to celebrate,
anyway. Omaha and Chicago and New York, Washington,
Philadelphia, Boston and other eastern cities
were making ready. They awaited only the word.</p>

<p>The Central had laid their four miles of track, lacking
a trifle. Like the Union Pacific, they had stopped
one pair of thirty-foot rails short of the meeting-place.</p>

<p>They had renamed their station of “Victory,” and
changed it to Rozel. They had set up a sign-board at
either end of their ten-mile stint, to announce to overland
passengers: “Ten Miles of Track in One Day.”
Their eight rail-carriers—Mike Shay, Pat Joyce,
Tom Daily, Mike Kennedy, Fred McNamara, Ed Killeen,
George Wyatt and Mike Sullivan—who had
toted all those ten miles of rails, without being spelled
once, were still the heroes of the day.</p>

<p>Having nothing especial to busy him this Sunday
afternoon, Terry straddled his horse and rode up to
the summit, to see the wonderful tie and the precious
spikes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>The summit of Promontory Point was pretty well
deserted, today, except for the little collection of tents
and shacks forming the “town” of Promontory.
The Central people had started a short siding, but had
quit, over Sunday. Down at the U. P. camp Pat was
darkly hinting that this C. P. siding would never be
finished, now.</p>

<p>“For they’ve gone to slape on the job; an’ b’ gorry
when they wake up they’re like to see a U. Pay. sidin’
in place, an’ the U. Pay. ownin’ the switchin’ rights at
the meetin’-place terminal. We lost Humboldt Wells,
mebbe, but we’ll not lose Promontory Point if we can
help it.”</p>

<p>Only the small gap of two rails’ length remained to
be filled in before trains might pass over the new
Pacific Railway between the Missouri River and the
Pacific coast. A mere fifty-eight feet, beyond the
telegraph pole that proudly floated a United States flag
(hoisted there by orders of General Dodge), broke the
iron trail of 1,770 miles. The tracks could be connected
up in a jiffy.</p>

<p>The Stanford special car, which was the private
car of Mr. Charles Crocker, the C. P. contractor and
construction boss, stood yonder upon the C. P. siding
spur. It was gaily decorated; but all the steps on one
side had been torn away in the trip out from Sacramento.
A careless Chinaman, felling timber above the
track, had landed a log upon the rails, and the Stanford
special, of only engine and car, had just escaped
a bad wreck.</p>

<p>The car had got through, though; and here it was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
guarded by the C. P. track-layer boss, H. H. Minkler,
and a squad of armed track men. Those gold spikes
would be a great prize for some of the “floaters” in
Promontory.</p>

<p>Terry being a friend, Mr. Minkler obligingly unlocked
the car and ushered him inside. There was
nobody here except a timid Chinaman cook. Everybody
else was sight-seeing.</p>

<p>Mr. Minkler removed the canvas cover from the tie.</p>

<p>“What do you think o’ that?”</p>

<p>“It sure is a beauty.” So it was—red and polished
like true mahogany, and set with a silver plate
on the side. “Where does it go, Mr. Minkler?”</p>

<p>“Read the plate and you’ll see.”</p>

<p>Terry stooped and read.</p>

<p class="center">THE LAST TIE<br>
Laid in the Completion of the Pacific Railroad<br>
May 10, 1869</p>

<p>That was the top inscription on the plate, followed
by the names of the officers and directors of the Central
Pacific.</p>

<p>“Heft it.”</p>

<p>“Whew, but it’s heavy! Is it made of mahogany?”</p>

<p>“No. Californy laurel; and a good solid piece,
too. Eight feet long, eight inches wide and six inches
deep, it is.”</p>

<p>“Somebody’ll steal it out of the track.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it won’t be left there. It’s a show tie. Those
holes already drilled in it are for the special spikes to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
set in. Mebbe you’d like to see them, too. All
right. Take a squint. Those two gold ones are from
Californy—one for Mr. Durant to drive at the U.
P. end, and the big one with the nugget head for
Governor Stanford to drive at the C. P. end. The
solid silver spike is from Nevady; they say a hundred
men each hit it one lick, in the forging. That other
spike is from Arizony. It’s a mixture of gold, silver
and iron. And I hear tell there’s a silver spike comin’
from Montany and another from Idyho.”</p>

<p>When Terry rode back for his own camp, he cast
calculating eye at the telegraph pole, again, with the
Flag floating. It stood at the U. P. end o’ track, like
an outpost marking a triumphal march across continent.
High over this high country above the great
Salt Lake the Starry Flag streamed in the evening
breeze, challenging the world of lake and desert to
show any better sight.</p>

<p>The last rays of the setting sun struck it full, promising
it a bright tomorrow, and Terry swung his hat at
it.</p>

<p>“Now if George only gets here early enough——!”
he planned. “Gee! Hope he does.”</p>

<p>That was of much importance, but was nothing to
worry over. George had been kept in Ogden, mostly,
with the pay-car. He’d be on hand, though. Nobody
who knew George Stanton might doubt this.</p>

<p>“A fine day ahead of us,” Pat prophesied, at the
camp, with jerk of his scarred thumb toward the
gorgeous yellow sunset. “Sure, we’re goin’ to be
blessed wid that—but b’ gorry we got to work all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
the night, to ’arn it, layin’ our side-track. Them’s
the orders from Gin’ral Casement an’ Gin’ral Dodge,
an’ they’re goin’ to boss the job themsilves whilst the
C. Pay. slape. ’Twill be the U. Pay.’s terminal.”</p>

<p>The night was sharp and starry, and ice formed on
the water buckets. The morning dawned as dear as
a bell, and fanned by a strong, nipping breeze. Pat’s
prophecy had come true.</p>

<p>Before daylight a few spectators had commenced to
toil through, in the distance, by horse, wagon and
buggy, from the ranches and towns eastward. The
boarding-train was made up early, to take the men
on from the construction camp. On the tender Terry
arrived at the head of the procession.</p>

<p>The plateau was getting lively. A sprinkling of
spectators by horse, wagon and buggy had come in
from the west also. By all-night work the U. P.
siding had been put in and completed. A squad of
Pat’s men were tamping the ties, and tossing jokes at
the C. P. men for having been outwitted. A squad
of Chinamen from the Central camp were pottering
along the C. P. roadbed. It all looked like business.</p>

<p>People continued to gather, and Terry fidgeted.
About ten o’clock the C. P. construction-train, with the
Stanford special as a trailer, puffed down, to halt at
C. P. end o’ track, and wait. Engine and cars were
fluttering with red, white and blue flags and bunting.
The name of the weather-beaten locomotive was
“Jupiter.”</p>

<p>Evidently President Stanford had been entertaining
a large breakfast party, for almost all the C. P. officials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
piled out: the governor, and Vice-President C.
P. Huntington, and Builder Crocker, and Construction
Superintendent J. H. Strobridge, and Chief Engineer
S. S. Montague, and Consulting Chief Engineer
George E. Gray, and a bunch of others—three
United States Pacific Railway commissioners and the
governors of Nevada and Arizona, among them, people
said.</p>

<p>There was one woman, Mrs. Strobridge, the Heroine
of the C. P., they called her, because she had
camped at the front, with her husband, all the way
during the building. But the U. P. had two heroines,
besides Virgie.</p>

<p>President Stanford and Vice-President Huntington
attracted the most attention. They were fine-appearing
men, in trousers and long coats of black broad-cloth,
their shoes polished, everything about them
spick and span as if they had come to a reception.
Ex-Governor Stanford had ruddy complexion and
kind, handsome face. He had been California’s war
governor. Vice-President Huntington was larger in
frame; broad and heavy and imposing. His face reminded
one of a lion’s. During all the years of the
railroad building he had made his headquarters in
New York, raising money for the company; but he
had traveled back and forth, back and forth, by stage
and railroad, nobody knew how many times. Both
he and Governor Stanford were reported to be very
rich.</p>

<p>They all trudged forward, to the space that had
been kept open from their end o’ track to the flag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
telegraph pole. There was shaking of hands, and
considerable eddying about. Terry viewed the
crowd, and the telegraph pole, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Dog-gone, why don’t our trains come?” he complained,
to himself. “Where’s that George?”</p>

<p>The U. P. boarding-train had backed out and entered
upon the siding, to clear the track. Now a
prolonged whistle sounded, from the east. Hurrah!
Terry recognized it; no one of the end o’ track force
on the U. P. line could mistake that whistle. Old
Number 119, the veteran construction-train engine,
of course! And here it came, hauling the first U. P.
excursion-train decorated from stem to stern with
the red, white and blue. He ran down track.</p>

<p>The train was loaded to the guards. Engineer
Richards and Fireman Bill Sweeny were in the cab;
George was hanging out from the cab steps, and
Virgie was riding on the pilot!</p>

<p>George made a flying leap, and a rush for Terry.</p>

<p>“Did many C. P. folks get here first? Who are
they all? We brought the whole U. P. gang in that
scrumptious patent Pullman—Vice-President Durant,
Colonel Seymour, Mr. Dillon and Mr. John Duff
of the directors, the Casements and General Dodge
and Mr. Reed and Major Hurd, and two silver spikes,
and a heap of people from New York and Chicago
and Boston and Omaha and I don’t know where else.
Your mother and my mother, too. There’s another
train right behind us, fetching Ogden’s mayor, and
a raft of other Mormons, from Salt Lake City, and
soldiers and a band from Fort Douglas down there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
Bet we have more people than the C. P. Is that
their only train?”</p>

<p>“Come on!” Terry bade. “I’ve found a place for
us, if we can make it before somebody else grabs it.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>Away they ran, Terry leading. They had to zigzag
through among the carriages and wagons and
horses and jostling spectators.</p>

<p>“We can get atop that telegraph pole, and see
everything.”</p>

<p>“Which pole?” panted George.</p>

<p>“The one with the flag on it.”</p>

<p>“How’ll we do it?”</p>

<p>“Shin up and sit on the cross-arm. It’s right
over the place.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they won’t let us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they will. Everything’s free.”</p>

<p>“Aw, shucks!” George puffed, slackening.
“Somebody else is there.”</p>

<p>So there was: a man had mounted to the cross-arm
and was astride it.</p>

<p>“Shucks!” agreed Terry. “I’d been saving that
for us.”</p>

<p>He, too, slackened, disappointed.</p>

<p>“We can take the next pole.”</p>

<p>“No; it’s too far off.” Then—“Come on!”
urged Terry. “He’s getting down. I know—he’s
a lineman, is all, tapping the wire.”</p>

<p>They ran again.</p>

<p>“He’s leaving a ladder. Hope it stays,” George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
gasped. “That’ll be nuts, if only nobody beats us.”
And he exclaimed: “It’s all right! That’s Harry!
That’s Harry Revere!”</p>

<p>They caught Harry at the foot of the pole.</p>

<p>“Hello! How’d you get here?”</p>

<p>Harry grinned.</p>

<p>“On that train.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see you,” George accused.</p>

<p>“Didn’t say you did. But I said I was going to
end at the front, and here I am. Reached Ogden
yesterday, and they sent me on out. I’m the boss
lightning-shooter, today.”</p>

<p>“What you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Send the news. Connect up my table yonder at
the track with San Francisco and Omaha, and tell
the United States what’s happening. Today’s the
day when I own the whole system; everything’s to
be kept open, waiting on Yours Truly.”</p>

<p>Off limped Harry, all business. Terry yelled after
him.</p>

<p>“We’re going to climb your pole, then.”</p>

<p>“All right. You can borrow it, but don’t you
monkey with my wires.”</p>

<p>The people around seemed to have no thought, yet,
of seizing upon the pole. They were too engaged in
staring about.</p>

<p>“Good eye,” George praised, as following Terry
he scrambled up the ladder and squirmed the rest of
the way to the cross-arm. “Say! This is shore
great. Where’s the place for the last spike, now?”</p>

<p>“Square below. It’ll be solid gold. I saw it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
Seven inches long, with a nugget for a head, and
worth $400. It’s from California, for President
Stanford to drive. And there’s another, not so big,
for Vice-President Durant. I saw the last tie, too,
and it’s a dandy—all polished like mahogany, with
a silver plate tacked to it and holes ready for the
spikes. Arizona and Nevada and Idaho are giving
silver spikes——”</p>

<p>“I know,” George interrupted. “I read the whole
program in the Ogden paper. The governors are to
make speeches, and so are the U. P. and C. P. folks;
and the telegraph line’s connected up with Harry’s
operator’s outfit so that bells will strike out East and
on the Coast when the last spike’s driven. Chicago
and New York and Boston and Washington and New
Orleans and St. Louis and Philadelphia will all be
notified at the same time by Omaha, and Sacramento
and San Francisco will get it direct. And old 119,
and old Jupiter of the C. P., will touch noses.”</p>

<p>“It’s a boss place to see from, anyhow,” observed
Terry.</p>

<p>The C. P. head officials had gone down track, to the
Pullman on the end of the U. P. special train. Presently
the whole party, for both roads, issued from
the Pullman, and came on. George chuckled.</p>

<p>“Talk about ‘last ties.’ That one Mr. Durant has
on beats the C. P. tie all to pieces!”</p>

<p>“It’s the last thing in ties, all right,” answered
Terry.</p>

<p>Vice-President Thomas C. Durant of the U. P.
New York office was rigged in festival attire, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
black velvet coat and a necktie so gay that it fairly
dazzled the eyes. General Dodge, Mr. Sidney Dillon,
the Casements, Major Marshall Hurd, Superintendent
Reed—they were there; and a heavy bushy-white-whiskered
old gentleman in broad-cloth suit, who was
Mr. John Duff of Boston, a leading director and the
father of young Mr. Duff; and several others.</p>

<p>The crowd cheered them. The sight below was a
stirring one. The second U. P. train had arrived;
from it were hastening another bevy of excursionists,
and the soldiers and band from Fort Douglas at Salt
Lake City. The track-layers and graders and surveyors
of both roads were swarming upon the standing
cars—they covered the tops of the coaches, and
stood upon the running-boards of 119 and Jupiter.
Yankees, Irishmen, Chinamen and even Indians and
Mexicans jostled one another for position.</p>

<p>Several people had followed Terry’s and George’s
example and climbed the ladder, but they could not
reach the cross-arm. Virgie had a good position, in
the cab of 119. The two Heroines of the U. P. and
the Heroine of the C. P. had met; they were given a
front place of honor. The companies of the United
States Infantry were drawn up, along the grade at the
gap in the track.</p>

<p>“Comp’ny—rest!” the captains barked; and the
blue-coat line, their hands in white gloves and every
button shining, stood at ease, while the band played.</p>

<p>All the engines were tooting, also. There was another
whistle, from the west. A second C. P. train
was coming, decorated from pilot to rear coach. Its
crowd thronged forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>The sun was getting higher overhead. At a word
from General Dodge, who seemed to be a sort of
master of ceremonies, the infantry captains crisply
ordered:</p>

<p>“Comp’ny—’tenshun! P’rade-rest!”</p>

<p>The officials and honor guests of the two roads
ranged themselves in the open space left at the gap.
General Dodge lifted his hand, for silence.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to begin. I
will ask you all to keep quiet, until after the ceremonies.
Kindly do not push forward, into this space
between the two engines. The wire in here is connected
with Omaha and San Francisco, so that the
news will be spread east and west simultaneously.
We will first listen to a prayer by the Reverend Dr.
Todd, of Massachusetts. Hats off, please.”</p>

<p>Hats were doffed. The Reverend Dr. Todd—a
venerable wrinkled gentleman—stepped forward, and
asked a blessing upon the work about to be completed.</p>

<p>Harry’s telegraph instrument had been clicking, on
the little table at which he sat hemmed in by people.</p>

<p>“The operator has said, to Omaha and San Francisco:
‘Almost ready. Hats off; prayer is being offered,’”
General Dodge announced. “Now he has
said: ‘We have got done praying. The spike is
about to be presented.’ But first I take pleasure in
introducing to you the Honorable Leland Stanford,
of Sacramento—ex-Governor of the great State of
California, and president of the Central Pacific Railroad
Company. He will address you.”</p>

<p>Amidst cheers Governor Stanford stood forth, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
made a short speech upon the union of the two roads.</p>

<p>“General Dodge! Dodge! Dodge! General
Dodge! Speech!” the crowd shouted. So General
Dodge, the chief engineer of the Union Pacific, made
a similar short speech.</p>

<p>The crowd commenced to cheer again—with
“Hurrah for the Pacific Railroad!” “Hurrah for
Stanford!” “Hurrah for Dodge!” “’Rah for the
Casements!” “’Rah for the Star Spangled Banner!”
“Hooray for the engineers!” “And don’t
forget the track men and graders! Hooray for the
Irish and the Mormons and the Chinks!” “Don’t
forget the money, either! Hooray for Durant and
Huntington!”</p>

<p>This might have kept up forever had not General
Dodge again raised his hand.</p>

<p>Here came Superintendent Reed, of the U. P., and
Superintendent Strobridge, of the C. P.—the two
construction chiefs—lugging the polished tie.</p>

<p>They carefully laid it into the little bed prepared
for it, while the spectators craned and “Oh’d” and
“Ah’d” in admiration.</p>

<p>Now here came the last rails—one pair from the
U. P. end, proudly carried by two squads of the U. P.
Irish, in clean shirts and trousers, and “bossed” by
Paddy Miles; one pair from the C. P. end, proudly
carried by two squads of the C. P. Chinamen, in
clean blouses and trousers, and bossed by Mr.
Minkler.</p>

<p>Harry’s telegraph instrument was clicking.</p>

<p>“Omaha has replied: ‘We understand. All are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
ready in the East,’” announced General Dodge.
“The word has been repeated in all the large cities.
The management of the Western Union Telegraph
Company in Washington has issued orders that the
lines are to be kept open throughout the continent
until after the ceremonies.”</p>

<p>The two pairs of rails had been gently placed, and
the fish-plate fastening at the joints adjusted. One
double length was spiked fast in the ordinary way.
Pat and his Irish squads and Boss Minkler and his
Chinaman squads filed off. The crowd burst into
another cheer; Terry and George, highest of all,
joined.</p>

<p>“There she is, complete,” George asserted.</p>

<p>“No. Wait!”</p>

<p>General Dodge was speaking.</p>

<p>“The time is at hand. The operator is sending
the message, east and west: ‘To everybody: Keep
quiet. When the last spike is driven at Promontory
Point we will say, “Done.” Don’t break the circuit,
but watch for the signals of the hammer blows. The
spike will soon be driven. The signal will be three
dots for the commencement of the blows.’ Omaha
has replied, so has San Francisco. The country is
waiting. We will now have the presentation of the
spikes. I take pleasure in introducing Congressman
Tritle, of Nevada Territory.”</p>

<p>The Honorable F. A. Tritle, of Nevada (who was
only trying to be governor), stepped forward, with a
bright silver spike. He faced Vice-President Durant.</p>

<p>“To the iron of the East and the gold of the West,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
Nevada adds her link of silver to span the continent
and wed the oceans.”</p>

<p>He handed the silver spike to Mr. Durant, and
bowed.</p>

<p>“Hooray!”</p>

<p>“Governor Safford, of Arizona,” General Dodge
announced.</p>

<p>Governor A. P. K. Safford of Arizona Territory
stepped forward, with his spike, of gold, silver and
iron.</p>

<p>“Ribbed in iron, clad in silver, and crowned with
gold, Arizona presents her offering to the enterprise
that had banded the continent and wedded the oceans.”</p>

<p>This spike also went to Vice-President Durant.</p>

<p>“Dr. Harkness, of Sacramento—who in behalf of
California presents two spikes, of pure gold,” announced
General Dodge.</p>

<p>“Which is the $400 one?” George demanded, of
Terry, wellnigh falling from the cross-arm as he
stretched his neck. There was such a tumult of
cheers that Terry barely heard him, and neither of
them could hear the speech by Dr. Harkness.</p>

<p>But he handed the two golden spikes to Governor
Stanford.</p>

<p>A sudden silence broke the cheering. Governor
Stanford held a little sledge with a silver head. Telegraph
wires ran from it to Harry’s table.</p>

<p>“When he hits the spike, they hear him clear at
Washington,” George whispered. “And in San
Francisco, too!”</p>

<p>“Sh!” Terry cautioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>The governor had passed one spike to Mr. Durant,
who stooped and inserted it into the hole in the polished
tie, at the end of the U. P. rail. He straightened,
expectantly, and grasped another sledge, with
iron head. Governor Stanford gazed around.</p>

<p>“All ready?”</p>

<p>“All ready, governor. The East and the West
are waiting. Mr. Durant, you may drive your spike,
if you please.”</p>

<p>Vice-President Durant, in his gay necktie and his
velvet coat, lifted his sledge; down it came, but he
was nervous, for——</p>

<p>“Aw, he hit the rail, didn’t he? He missed!”
George blurted.</p>

<p>“Sure did,” Terry chuckled. “But I guess it’s
all right. Now Governor Stanford’s going to try.”</p>

<p>“The last spike will be driven by President and Governor
Stanford,” announced General Dodge, at the top
of his voice. “He dug the first shovelful of earth on
the Central Pacific, at Sacramento; he will complete
the work, on Promontory Point. Wait, everybody.”</p>

<p>Governor Stanford poised his silver-headed sledge.
He tapped with it—and he, too, struck the rail! But
that made no difference. Harry’s telegraph instrument
clicked, just the same—“dot,” “dot,” “dot.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers, now, everybody!” shouted General
Dodge. “We have signaled: ‘Done!’ The Liberty
Bell in Independence Hall at Philadelphia is ringing,
a great ball at Washington has fallen, the blows
here have been repeated on the city hall bell at San
Francisco. At the third dot from the wire a salute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
was fired from Fort Point, there and 100 guns are
answering at Omaha. The whole nation is celebrating!
Three cheers, everybody, for the Pacific Railroad—the
union of the East and of the West!”</p>

<p>The air rocked with cheers and whoops and the
shrieks of the engines. Hats went sailing helter-skelter.
The band burst into “Hail, Columbia.”
And again George almost tumbled from his perch, but
Terry grabbed him just in time.</p>

<p>General Dodge called for silence. Harry was clicking
busily.</p>

<p>“The operator is sending the following message:
‘Promontory Summit, Utah, May 10, 1869. The last
rail is laid, the last spike is driven. The Pacific Railroad
is completed. The point of junction is 1,086
miles west of the Missouri River, and 690 miles east
of Sacramento City.’ Signed: ‘Leland Stanford,
Central Pacific Railroad. T. C. Durant, Sidney Dillon,
John Duff, Union Pacific Railroad.’ The remaining
spikes will now be driven, before the passage of the
trains; and anybody who desires is invited to strike
one blow each, in turn.”</p>

<p>Paddy Miles and Mr. Minkler had rapidly set the
spikes; and immediately a regular line of people
formed, to seize the sledges. The U. P. and C. P.
officials and their guests of honor started in, first,
though—the Heroine of the Central blushingly conducted
forward by Vice-President Huntington, and
the two Heroines of the Union Pacific escorted by
Vice-President Durant.</p>

<p>“Come on!” bade George, excited. “I want to hit
a lick, don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“You bet I do.”</p>

<p>And down they slid, to the ladder, and from the
ladder to the ground.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll be too late.”</p>

<p>“Listen! Some of ’em are hitting the rails, again.”</p>

<p>Judging by the laughter, that was true. But they
wormed their way through, to the fore. One after
another the amateur spikers were whanging at the
spikes. Terry espied Pat.</p>

<p>“Don’t we get a chance, Pat?”</p>

<p>“An’ haven’t yez hit a spike, yet?” Pat likewise
was excited. “Sure, now, nayther have some o’ the
rist of ’em. I wouldn’t pay the best two bits a day,
on me gang. But take my sledge, now. There’s the
wan silver spike from Nevady, a-waitin’, set in its
hole. Hit her a whack apiece an’ niver mind whether
it’s silver or iron. An’ if annywan says for yez to
lay off, tell ’em Paddy Miles told yez to go ahead.”</p>

<p>George grabbed the sledge, and dived for the silver
spike of the U. P. rail, opposite the U. P. gold spike.</p>

<p>“You first,” Terry panted. “Quick. Don’t you
miss it.”</p>

<p>“I’m—not goin’—to—MISS—it,” hissed
George, as his sledge came down—Whack!
“There! Hit her a lick, yourself.”</p>

<p>Terry struck—Whack! Buried the silver spike.</p>

<p>“By Jiminy, we drove one spike, anyhow,” they
proclaimed.</p>

<p>They had been none too soon. Only the last golden
spike remained untouched, except for the light taps
by President Stanford and Vice-President Huntington
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>Governor Stanford shouted vigorously.</p>

<p>“Stand aside, everybody. The path-finders of the
two roads—the men who led the rails to the meeting-point:
Chief Engineer General Grenville M. Dodge of
the Union Pacific, and Chief Engineer Samuel S.
Montague of the Central Pacific, will land the final
blows upon the last spike.”</p>

<p>The two engineers stood, each with a sledge.</p>

<p>“I first?” politely queried General Dodge.</p>

<p>“No, general. The last blow shall be yours. You
have come the farthest,” Mr. Montague insisted.</p>

<p>He landed easily; made a good shot, and the nugget-headed
spike was sunk two-thirds way. Mr. Montague
stepped aside; with a bow and a smile the general
took position; landed, and the spike had sunk to
its battered nugget.</p>

<p>“Let’s skip to our pole, so as to see when the engines
touch noses,” George proposed. He and Terry scuttled
for their pole, again. Up they scrambled, for the
cross-arm—a very fine place.</p>

<p>The rails had been firmed. The people were being
forced back, to clear the track. Old 119, of the U. P.,
Terry’s father and Fireman Bill Sweeny—yes, and
George’s father and Virgie also—in the cab, and old
Jupiter, of the C. P., had been unhooked from their
trains; they whistled—Toot! Toot!—and slowly
advanced toward each other, bringing the cheering
track men and graders who clung to every inch that
was not too hot.</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly, they crept forward, the one over
the U. P. rails, the other over the C. P. rails; and just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
at the gold-and-silver-studded laurel tie they touched
pilots.</p>

<p>Terry’s father swung out from his cab, to the pilot,
a bottle of champagne in his hand. The engineer of
old Jupiter swung out, opposite, with a bottle. They
reached aside, and each broke his bottle upon the
other’s cow-catcher, so that the wine flowed down
upon the joint and tie.</p>

<p>“The wedding of the rails is accomplished,”
shouted General Dodge. “The two roads have been
made one, never to be parted.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!”</p>

<p>“Same as the launching of a ship, huh?” George
blatted. “Sure. It’s a wedding and baptizing, both.”</p>

<p>The two engines, rubbing noses, waited until a photographer
had taken another picture or two. Then
they backed out again, coupled on to their trains, the
C. P. train backed farther——</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Terry.</p>

<p>For old 119 was coming on, train and all, with
Virgie perched alone on the pilot! It passed clear
over, into C. P. territory.</p>

<p>“She said she’d be the first passenger across by
U. P., and so she is,” George remarked. “That’s
right But she’s awful stubborn.”</p>

<p>“Hooray! Hooray!” And Virgie waved, delighted.</p>

<p>The U. P. train backed, to clear, and old Jupiter
hauled the C. P. train across, into U. P. territory.</p>

<p>As soon as the C. P. train had backed out again, and
the meeting-place was free, Paddy Miles and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
Minkler led a charge of workmen into it; like experts
they pried the ends of the rails from the last tie, jerked
out the precious spikes, and the precious tie; slipped an
ordinary tie under and in business fashion spiked the
rails down again with ordinary spikes.</p>

<p>“What’s their rush, do you reckon?”</p>

<p>“You’ll see,” laughed Terry.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the track squads left, bearing their
spoils, when the crowd swarmed into the spot, and
jostled and clawed and dug.</p>

<p>“Souvenirs! They’re after souvenirs!” George
rapped. “Want one? Want a piece of tie, or something?”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” scoffed Terry. “We might as well go
down, though. Everything’s over. But I guess after
a fellow’s lived at the front for a couple of years, and
helped build the road, like you and I have, he doesn’t
need any ‘souvenir’ to remember it by!”</p>

<p>“Right you are, boy,” George agreed. “I’d rather
have something to eat. Best thing we can do is to
catch a ride back. It’s a quarter to one.”</p>

<p>Down they plumped, to the ground, and were breaking
for the U. P. trains, when they ran almost slap into
young Mr. Duff.</p>

<p>“By gracious! Hello. Where’ve you boys been?
I wondered——”</p>

<p>“Up on the telegraph pole, most the time,” explained
Terry, as they all shook hands heartily.
“Where’ve <i>you</i> been? Funny we didn’t see you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve been running ’round, with the crowd. I
came out from Boston with my dad. You both have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
grown so, I didn’t recognize you, on top that pole.
But hurrah, anyway,” and young Mr. Duff laughed
boyishly. “Well, here we all are, at the finish. So
you stuck it out, did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, siree!” declared George. “Everybody stuck
it out. Nobody quit.”</p>

<p>“The two roads laid over 1,000 miles of track in
thirteen months; did you know?” Terry asked.</p>

<p>“Of course I know. The whole country knows;
papers have been full of it. Whew, but I’d like to
have been along, on the job; across the deserts and
across the mountains, and clear here, to the meeting
of the tracks. Expect you’re right proud.”</p>

<p>“Naw, we’re too hungry to be swelled up much,”
bluffly answered George. “But it was no slouch of a
job, just the same. Was it, Terry?”</p>

<p>“Not for Joe!” Terry asserted, in the latest slang.
“But everybody’s proud, I guess—from General
Dodge and Mr. Durant, down to us.”</p>

<p>“Do <i>you</i> know?” said young Mr. Duff, abruptly—as
if he had discovered something. “When a fellow
looks at this iron trail, clear across country, he realizes
that it’s a great thing to be an American.”</p>
